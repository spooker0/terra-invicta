TITechTemplate.summary.Accelerando=We consider our prospects in a galaxy apparently teeming with aggressive life.
TITechTemplate.description.Accelerando=We have passed the point where we can consider changes to the human experience to be merely incremental - from this point on, they will be revolutionary, unprecedented, and even unknowable. Our changes will accelerate, as we cease to be a species making hesitant forays away from its homeworld and instead become one whose remote colonies become the forefront of its civilization. We should plan for this time of sweeping change as best we can. This begins with understanding that it is in our orbital habitats and planetary settlements where we will make the greatest leaps in science, technology and spacecraft manufacturing, and that those once-humble places are fated to become great nations themselves. Beyond our system lie countless worlds, any of which might well be home to life, whose intentions we cannot know. Thus, we must empower Earth's every off-shoot to not only to reach those distant worlds, but also to defend humanity against them, should it be required.

So now we must go forth, into the mystery."<br/><align=right>{escapeLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>In an undated letter to his father<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.AdAstra=The march of technological progress alone cannot transform a species: we must dramatically further our ambitions too. If humanity is to truly ascend, our entire culture must actively pursue a future far beyond Earth's atmosphere. Even our education systems should be built around this - teaching our children not only the history of space travel, but also its boundless future. If science and mathematics are introduced early and emphasized often, the human race will, in time, no longer see space as the final frontier, but merely the next of many.

TITechTemplate.description.AdministrationAlgorithms=Now that we have developed functioning artificial intelligence, we can explore the many ways in which machine consciousness can enrich human society. One of the most obvious, and immediately appealing, applications is to hand the day-to-day running of our factories, nations, and off-world colonies to what are, in effect, all-knowing yet entirely selfless entities. They can administrate public services, they can regulate the markets, they can automate space traffic, they can safely operate and maintain hazardous deep-space reactors and mining facilities. In effect, they can direct almost every aspect of society while nevertheless remaining our faithful servants. Furthermore, they will be able to adapt to a changing galactic map faster than can the human brain. Our world-class software engineers are confident they have finally developed a reliable and safe beta version of what will surely be the first of many such AI administrators. Those leaders who feel most prepared for this new dawn may begin the roll-out at once.

TITechTemplate.summary.AdvancedAtomicManipulation=Atom coupling enables the creation of ultra-strong nanostructures that otherwise cannot be fabricated.

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedAtomicManipulation=Atomic manipulation was conceived as far back as 1989, when a major computer firm successfully spelled out its own name in atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Of particular interest to us is using STMs to bind individual atoms to different types of surfaces, creating new and artificial nanostructures, potentially of great strength, which otherwise could not exist. New and more powerful STMs can further refine these techniques, ultimately increasing the strength of the bonds while reducing the energy requirements.

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedCarbonManipulation=To build our way to the stars, we will require far more efficient resources than we have now. As the fourth most abundant element in the universe (and indeed the second most in the human body), carbon is a near-endless and highly-adaptable resource. By developing our understanding of carbon's properties and limits, we have become able to manipulate it at a molecular level. This will enable the creation of ever more impressive, yet ever more affordable, building materials and structures - both here on Earth and, eventually, throughout the galaxy.

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedChemicalRocketry=Since the middle of the 20th century and right up to the present day, rocketry has relied on old-fashioned chemical combustion. Fuel and oxidizer are mixed and ignited within a combustion chamber, creating a propellant that is then expelled to generate thrust. A tried and tested method, and one which remains as fundamental now as it did decades ago. However, we can improve our existing designs to be far more fuel-efficient and significantly safer. By using lighter materials and refining our propellants to become more stable, this classical method of propulsion can take us across greater distances at lower costs.

Something better."<br/><align=right>{submitLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Interview with the American Christian Television System<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedFissionSystems=Though fission technology has advanced standard solid core to gas core systems, and enabled dramatic strides in both our spaceship drives and habitats, its efficiency remains hampered by energy loss, fuel inadequacies and other engineering limitations.<br/><br/>To overcome these shortcomings, we have at last designed a new advanced fission system that combines the magnetic confinement of our gas core reactors with the breeding capabilities of our molten core systems. By layering these two reactor systems around each other, we have created a central molten core breeding reaction that can slowly burn through a wide variety of fuel sources to generate power. This core is also enclosed within an ongoing gaseous reaction, which captures the neutrons from the molten reaction to sustain its own chain reaction. Solid-state energy collectors transform the energy released as electromagnetic radiation and charged particles from both reactions into usable electricity for the spaceship.<br/><br/>These advanced fission systems will carry us to the farthest corners of our solar system - and ever-closer to our alien visitors.

TITechTemplate.displayName.AdvancedHeatManagementConcepts=Advanced Heat Management Concepts
TITechTemplate.summary.AdvancedHeatManagementConcepts=Scientists consider novel ways of containing and removing waste heat from our spacecraft.

When that flame touches another, nothing in this world can stand in its way."<br/><align=right>{submitLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Module 3, Chapter 4 of the <I>Burn Brighter</I> improvement course<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedHeatManagementConcepts=One cannot simply open a window while on a spaceship. As such, there is no simple way of releasing the accumulated heat of several dozen human bodies and countless computer systems, reactors and weapons - but if it is not removed, anyone onboard will soon die of extreme heat prostration, while the ship itself will ultimately melt. Conduction, convection or radiation are the only possible means of thermal energy transfer, and of those only radiation is currently feasible within the empty vacuum of space. This means radiators, but unfortunately that means bulk, which is itself deeply undesirable. However, liquid droplet radiators appear to be the answer we need. By replacing a solid surface radiator with one that sprays cooling droplets (which are then recaptured and reused) across large, thin radiators, we can reduce the mass from approximately 1300kg to under 100 kg. This does require special liquids with a vapour pressure so low that they can resist evaporation before recapturing, but our latest breakthroughs in this field have resulted in droplet supplies that will last several decades before needing to be replaced. Meanwhile, theoretical future nano-materials will ultimately reduce both the size and the mass of the radiators.

TITechTemplate.displayName.AdvancedHydrogenContainment=Advanced Hydrogen Containment
TITechTemplate.summary.AdvancedHydrogenContainment=Researchers look for new methods to contain unwieldy forms of spacecraft propellant.
TITechTemplate.quote.AdvancedHydrogenContainment="One cannot simply squeeze a balloon into a tin can without one or the other bursting. Which itself depends upon which you make stronger, and which you make weaker."<br/><align=right>{cooperateLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Interviewed for "A History of Space Travel," BBC Radio 4<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedHydrogenContainment=Every gram counts when it comes to spaceship design - mass is the enemy of movement. Unfortunately, that applies to the propellant itself - a vicious circle that means the more kilos of propellant a ship stores, the more propellant it needs. Past a certain point, this becomes infeasible, which is why the only real solution is to reduce propellant mass. Liquid hydrogen has the lowest mass and provides the best specific impulse - i.e. efficient thrust - of the propellants available to us, but its low density means that it requires enormous storage tanks and extreme refrigeration in order to prevent evaporation. So we must establish how to reduce hydrogen's storage density. New breakthroughs in cryo-compression have finally allowed us to increase a higher energy density without suffering undue boil-off, while magnetic fields enable our hydrogen storage tanks to maintain a much higher pressure without risk of disaster. Hydrogen remains a devilish substance to contain, to be sure, but these discoveries working in tandem will allow our spacecraft to carry far vaster quantities of it than ever before.

TITechTemplate.displayName.AdvancedMagnetics=Advanced Electromagnetism

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedMagnetics=To meet the alien arrival in kind, we will require a paradigm shift in our own technology. We must reach the stars, both so that they can become a staging ground for the advancement and defense of humanity, and so that we can tap their remarkable resources for ourselves. In addition, to counter the advanced weapons our rivals might wield against us, we will require bleeding-edge armaments of our own.<br/><br/>Our scientists believe that the best way forwards is via magnetics on a hitherto unprecedented scale. Their tests have successfully demonstrated that precise sequential firing of a row of powerful electromagnets can grant incredible acceleration to a moving object. In time, they believe we will be able to apply this to a handheld weapon's projectile, to rapidly 'catapult' resources from deep space to our facilities, or to build spacecraft capable of boosting their propulsion to reach once-impossible speeds - and destinations. Furthermore, they theorize that powerful magnetic fields may be used to contain new and unstable forms of energy.<br/><br/>These latest advancements are but a gateway to a brighter future. We cannot yet wholly dispense with the old ways of propulsion, transport and containment, but certainly a reality where we can dramatically augment them with magnetic force is within reach. The doorway to tomorrow yawns opens before us. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.AdvancedMissileWarfareDoctrine=Advanced Missile Warfare Doctrine
TITechTemplate.summary.AdvancedMissileWarfareDoctrine=New types of ship, carrying new types of armor and new types of weapon, require new types of missiles.

Department of Peace Operations<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedMissileWarfareDoctrine=Spacecraft design is not standing still, and so neither should missile design. As the craft we encounter develop more resilient armor, changing heat signatures, faster maneuvering, and more effective counter-measures, our own ships need a wider range of possible responses - including more destructive payloads and faster, yet less predictable, missile movement. Ultimately, nuclear torpedoes may be required to overcome the largest and most well-defended ships. To facilitate this, our weapon engineers have drawn up a raft of proposals on how to evolve the humble missile for the next age of space combat.

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedNeuralNetworks=Modern neural networks are computational learning and predictive modeling systems, predominantly used for speech and image recognition, medical diagnosis, and even spam filtering. New advancements in this field draw from biotechnology, seeking to make them behave more like a human mind. This dramatically increases their range of applications, and renders them capable of recognizing and understanding far more of the world around them. What are, in effect, digital yet non-sentient brains can solve the previously unsolvable, whether it be deciphering the mysteries of the cosmos, curing the most stubborn of diseases, or simply easing many of the tiny burdens and inconveniences that complicate our lives, such as recognizing plants, directing air traffic, or generating the text for video games. Importantly, these next-generation neural networks are also a crucial stepping stone towards true artificial intelligence.

TITechTemplate.description.AdvancedSuperconductors=As we approach the theoretical limits of our energy and data transfer capabilities, it is necessary to adapt existing methods to keep up with our ever-increasing hunger for both power and information. Whether based on traditional BCS material, cuprates, or more recent ferropnictides, superconductive material can unfortunately only function at extremely low temperatures - an inherent ceiling that we now must shatter. By exploring more efficient, and far less cumbersome, methods of nitrogen-based cooling, we can now create superconductive substances that are several orders of magnitude more efficient than the current generation, able to conduct truly vast amounts of energy near-losslessly, even in room-temperature environments. Considering the ever-growing human dependence upon both data and electrical energy, such breakthroughs should be considered an absolute necessity for each and every society. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.AntimatterContainment=Antimatter Containment
TITechTemplate.summary.AntimatterContainment=Physicists develop ways to safely store antimatter in a system composed of normal matter.

TITechTemplate.description.AntimatterContainment=For all the breathless stories about mirror realities, antimatter is very real, and indeed is identical to matter in almost every way - save for that an antimatter particle's charge is exactly opposite to that of the corresponding matter particle. For this reason, antimatter is famously incompatible with matter, the two destroying each other in a fierce burst of energy should they meet. It is a pernicious problem to solve in a world made of matter, but with incredible dividends if overcome, for it is precisely the violent reaction between matter and antimatter that could power the engines and weapons of tomorrow. We have for some time been able to create antimatter, but key to further progress is to 'trap' antiparticles to safely store them by preventing their premature self-annihilation. Our recent breakthroughs in both magnetic fields and the direct manipulation of atoms have at last made this possible. Matter and antimatter particles can now be kept at opposite ends of a magnetic trap, nudged into place by oscillating electric fields - and towards each other when the time is right. The further refinement of such containment systems will doubtless soon lead to the creation of drives and reactors of incredible power.

TITechTemplate.displayName.AntimatterMassProduction=Antimatter Mass Production
TITechTemplate.summary.AntimatterMassProduction=Antimatter, nature's ultimate battery, requires huge amounts of energy to produce in mass quantities.
TITechTemplate.quote.AntimatterMassProduction="We squat upon a dying world, sucking it dry long past the point when it can still sustain us. And yet an entire galaxy of possibility beckons.

TITechTemplate.description.AntimatterMassProduction=A frustrating paradox: matter/antimatter-based reactors could solve our every power need, both on Earth and in space, but the creation of sufficient antiparticles in the first place requires vast amounts of energy, not to mention vast and costly machines. It is not, for instance, even remotely practical to install a 30m antiproton decelerator of the sort housed at CERN within every starship. Yet more problematic is that even our most advanced particle accelerators achieve only 0.01% efficiency in terms of converting electricity to antimatter, with the remainder becoming heat - as problematic as it is wasteful. The proposed solution is vast arrays of solar panels in space, powering antimatter factories whose output is then magnetically trapped, ready for transport to spacecraft and terrestrial reactors. In consequence, we have truly achieved the power source of tomorrow.

TITechTemplate.displayName.AntimatterPropulsion=Antimatter Propulsion
TITechTemplate.summary.AntimatterPropulsion=Engineers innovate methods of directing the violent energy of antimatter reactions into space flight.

TITechTemplate.description.AntimatterPropulsion=Now that we are able to generate antimatter on an industrial scale, we can at last investigate how to convert the incredible energies generated by matter/antimatter collision to high-speed space travel. Containment, rather than propulsion itself, has been the most pressing issue to address, for even the smallest unintended meeting between opposing particles could rip a ship apart. On both fronts, electromagnetic fields are once again our closest ally here, both containing and directing these destructive forces wherever we see fit. A further complication is that proton-antiproton collisions also generate gamma rays - deadly radiation, in other words. However, our prior breakthroughs in atomic manipulation enable us to create ultra-lightweight nano-materials to act as radiation shielding, both throughout the ship and within its crews' clothing. All of this means employing a near-preposterous degree of health and safety measures in addition to bleeding-edge technology, but the destination very much justifies the arduous journey - we will have the capability to travel, and harness, the distant stars like never before.

TITechTemplate.description.AntimatterWeaponry=Within a spaceship, the gamma rays generated by antimatter reactions are wildly undesirable. Within a weapon, it is the opposite - the violent explosion caused by matter/antimatter collision will damage armor, while the radiation will further harm any lifeform within it. As always with antimatter, however, the thorniest problem to solve is ensuring it only mixes with corresponding matter when we want it to - the destruction from an antimatter bomb or torpedo inadvertently detonated while in a ship's ammunition stores would be catastrophic. It is precisely this destructive potential we wish to harness - even without the gamma side-effects - as the self-annihilation caused by matter/antimatter reactions is such that mixing a mere half-gram of each releases 40 percent more energy than did the first atomic bomb. Of course, we will be using far more than half a gram for our forthcoming weapons: By suspending hydrogen and antihydrogen particles within an empty vacuum, constrained by a magnetic bottle, our scientists believe the risks are sufficiently mitigated to permit the production of antimatter-based explosives. This will herald a new era of cosmic warfare.

TITechTemplate.description.AppliedArtificialIntelligence=Though our previously-developed neural networks approximate the function of a human brain, they remain, in essence, algorithms, and not a true intelligence in any meaningful way. The potential of digital consciousness is near-boundless - fully autonomous, code-based entities that can liberate humanity from the dangers and drudgery of construction work, mining, and maintenance, to name but a few. A world where robots and computers shoulder all our heaviest burdens. The myriad hazards of our operations in space make this more of a necessity than ever before - why endanger human life when a computer can do it for us? Yet the obstacle to progress has not been merely processing power and software refinement, but also safety - ensuring both that these AIs can indeed be entrusted with our lives, and that they cannot become self-aware enough to seek a higher purpose for themselves. Yet at last our software engineers are confident they have struck a happy balance, their prior breakthroughs in quantum computing giving rise to a wholly digital intelligence, capable of dutifully operating deep-space facilities without human intervention.

TITechTemplate.description.ArcLasers=We have reached once-impossible technological heights as a spacefaring race, yet the dangers we face have not dissipated.<br/><br/>To better protect ourselves from these, our researchers have designed a new evolution of directed-energy weapon: the arc laser. By replacing the old laser mediums, such as gas or crystal, with plasma, arc lasers can generate more intense beams, with greatly-improved efficiency. The plasma is contained using magnetic fields with a constant flow that - much like clouds in a thunderstorm - separates the ions within by charge, creating two poles. Once the poles have accumulated enough charge, a lightning arc surges through the plasma, releasing an intense burst of energy in the form of light - which the Arc Laser then weaponizes into a deadly pulse.<br/><br/>The true beauty of this technology is the rapid recharge rate of the plasma, creating a combat laser with greater efficiency and range than any previous generation.

TITechTemplate.description.PrinciplesofSpaceWarfare=The wild expanse of space invites humanity to stake its claim, but who can say what resistance we might face in the years and decades ahead - whether from threats as yet unknown, or from each other? It is territory that will, at times, require defense, as will any pioneers we send forth into it. In time, we will doubtless develop new types of weapons, specifically designed for space combat and without dependence upon cumbersome, finite, and volatile ammunition stores. In the shorter term, however, the most practical approach, for which we now have detailed and proven schematics, is to modify our existing weapons for effective use in space rather than on land or sea. There is much to consider, both practically - the effects of low and microgravity on velocity and targeting, safety of usage, armoring - and bureaucratically. We must establish not only the most potent methods of space warfare, but also the <i>rules</i> of space warfare. The apportioning of borders, the rights surrounding unmanned objects such as satellites, the usage of non-kinetic attacks, damage to the 'environment' of space, and that destruction of a ship or station might cost dozens, even hundreds of human lives. And so the doctrine now brought before us concerns not only how to effectively fight in space, but also the complex conditions of do so.

TITechTemplate.description.ArrivalCulture=Since the days when we still believed the stars were our gods and ancestors, the human journey has been characterized by the individual's search for meaning. Yet our cultural evolution across millennia has brought us more questions than answers, as we attempt to reconcile our own brief lives with the bigger picture of human existence. Now our quest for self-actualization is confounded by the confirmation of life from other worlds. It is imperative that cultures across the globe accept the shocking truth that humanity is not, after all, the center of all things. We cannot stand still: now is the time to change our very way of life. Our artists must encourage others to reflect this new reality, our philosophers must re-examine what it means to be human, and our religious institutions must square seemingly insurmountable circles. The concept that humanity is but a grain of sand on a far vaster beach has moved from conjecture to near certainty: Every effort must now be made to adjust to the revelation that we are not the universe's only thinking beings.

As populations across the world contend with the new reality that an extrasolar species has turned its eye upon us, this challenge is far greater than ever before, and we can no longer look to our own history for solutions or predictions. Will these aliens bring enlightenment or extermination? Will their arrival herald a new age of opportunity, or result in a curtailing of freedom? And, most of all, how will each given nation respond to this unprecedented visitation? Each society's reaction to this seismic event will shape the destiny of every person within its hierarchy for decades to come.

As speculation abounds regarding their intention and we contend with the possibility we are no longer an apex predator, the potential for riches or ruin has never been greater. Today's banking and investment systems were not designed to cope with such a sweeping change to Earth's place in the universe, both in terms of domestic adjustment to the alien arrival, and in terms of humanity's likely future amongst the stars. We must task our best economists with calming the startled markets, funding new ways of living, and ultimately laying the groundwork for deep-space society and commerce.

Will taxes take food from my family? Is that armed man in a uniform an ally, an obstacle, or a threat? In the end, good governance results from a million small interactions between people being conducted with, at a minimum, a measure of assurance that law and policy are not being carried out arbitrarily; that if one follows the state's rules, the state will not betray them and impose unnecessary suffering.

TITechTemplate.description.ArrivalInternationalDevelopment=With the confirmation of extraterrestrial life, not to mention the stepping up of our efforts to colonize space, international borders have become an increasingly antiquated notion. It is vital that the planet as a whole, and not the most powerful nations and organizations, prospers as we greet this new dawn, else millions of lives will be left behind. With that in mind, our economists and architects have drawn up a tranche of suggestions on how to raise up economically disadvantaged regions and to ensure they will benefit from the wider march of progress. New trade and travel routes (like the Suez Canal, but on a far grander scale) are the most important aspect of this, as it becomes increasingly necessary to generate colossal quantities of resources and technology, then carry it from shore-to-shore with minimal delay. There are many who hope such developments will be the final stepping stone towards a truly united Earth. Whether individual nations' and factions' vested interests will preclude this fond dream remains to be seen.

TITechTemplate.description.ArrivalInternationalRelations=The balance of international power has always been a delicate thing. Resource scarcity, contested territory, conflicting ideologies, ancient allegiances, naked greed: these are but a handful of the factors that have shaped the course of human history. The addition of a sentient species of uncertain intent, hailing from worlds unknown, only serves to complicate international relationships even further. Old alliances are tested as new players seek to capitalize on the disruption, while individual nations' self-interest reigns supreme. Looming large above it all is the variable of the aliens themselves. Will they prove to be a common threat? Or will they tip the scales towards a fortunate few? If our world is to keep turning, its many nations must establish better ways of working together. After long and arduous negotiations, we now have a template for a new kind of international politics - checks and balances that will be essential to keep our planet relatively united in the face of such unprecedented change.

Whatever the long-term consequences of the alien arrival, we can never revert to a world where terrestrial humanity considers only its own needs, rights and behaviors. The creaking, ancient structures that are our laws, both national and international, were not designed with such an uncanny prospect in mind, and so there must now be a flurry of new edicts and powers. We must establish not just how we respond to our unexpected visitors, but also how and if we integrate the discoveries that arise from their presence in our lives. The implications for genetics alone necessitate an entire new field of law and ethics. Beyond that, there are also the endless complications of life in space - who can make claim to what, what borders there should be, and which technologies must be liberated from patents in order to benefit all mankind. We have thus commissioned the world's best legal minds to draft what is, in effect, a new international constitution; an eye-wateringly complicated starting point from which all the world's nations (and beyond) can begin to legislate for this anxious, bold new era.

TITechTemplate.description.ArrivalMassCommunications=Whoever controls the media, controls the mind. Though the platforms of mass media and debate have changed almost beyond recognition over recent decades, that essential truth remains the same. The arrival event has caused not just widespread panic, but also widespread opportunism - for many, the hysteria caused by this grandest of revelations is the ideal way to control hearts and minds. Conspiracy theories, ultra-nationalism, radicalization, and even misplaced religious awe abound, and it is important that cooler heads manage the message before society falls into greater division than ever before. Maintaining order and coordinating Earth's response to both this and any future visitations is crucial, and there is much to be gained from establishing new ways in which the world's leaders might address our species as a whole. It is increasingly likely that humanity will one day be dispersed throughout the stars, and if we are to retain any sense of togetherness, we will need effective lines of communication across worlds.

Our brains, evolved and wired in the Stone Age to worry about things like food, predatory animals, and opportunities for mating, were having trouble enough adapting to a wired, bureaucratic world where the most dangerous threats - such as climate change - are neither immediate nor visible, and the presence of aliens among us is overloading our already taxed minds. Will aberrant behaviors increase as humans become hopeless and adopt an every-man-for-himself approach to the world? Will we be able to widen our concept of our tribe to all of humanity as our differences fade in comparison to the aliens? Understanding how our minds have been shaped by evolution and culture to deal with this strange new stimulus from the stars will lead to the self-awareness we need to shape our collective response.

Overzealous or frightened officials may themselves overreact to perceived threats of mundane origin, leading to a loss of faith, radicalization, or even tit-for-tat episodes of violence. Each nation's security apparatus faces a choice: try to maintain public faith through openness and consistent and fair application of law, or to enact draconian measures under the mantra of keeping the public safe from the alien threat.

TITechTemplate.description.ArrivalSociology=It is one thing to legislate the world's response to this alien dawn; it is quite another for us, as both individuals and communities, to adapt to what is, in effect, a species-wide existential crisis. Our behaviors will inevitably change, now that we know the sky is a gateway to the unimaginable. Countless organizations will spring up to cater to new technologies, new desires, and new fears. Borders will crumble, and new ones will arise. There will be mobs, there will be cults, there will be despots, and, most of all, there will be countless souls in need of support and guidance. Plotting the likely path of the coming societal change is necessary before we can meaningfully prepare for it. The world's leading sociologists, psychologists, and behaviorists have formed a symposium to understand and predict what is to come, and from there we can plan effective policies, treaties, laws, means of planet-wide communication, and, optimistically, hitherto undreamed of ways to ensure humanity can stand together as one in the days to come.

In short, AR is the bright promise of instant access to all human knowledge in any given situation. As we devise new forms of wearable technology and refine the algorithms that drive them, so too can we expand the uses of AR to better prepare our military, keep our populace both informed and entertained, and more rapidly train the coming generation of space-travelers.

The earliest forms of biotechnology include cross-breeding and artificial selection, and it has since come to encompass medicine, textiles, and fuel. Modern biotech makes changes on a cellular and even molecular level, but with the same key intent - improving upon Mother Nature, and bending her further to humanity's will. In the face of the challenges and opportunities posed by the alien arrival, we must push the boundaries of biotech further than ever before. Our latest breakthroughs enable us to create and refine new forms of life, intended to meet humanity's ever-growing need for food and fuel, to fight disease and ease suffering, and to restore our planet's health. Naturally, potential applications for biological warfare are also a consideration.

TITechTemplate.description.CarbonNanotubes=By furthering our research into the manipulation of carbon atoms, we can now create a new nanostructure that is both far stronger and far lighter than metal. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a new, artificial molecule, consisting of chemically-bonded carbon atoms rolled into a cylinder mere nanometers in diameter. To the naked eye, sufficient quantities of CNTs resemble a powder - one that can then be incorporated into other materials, such as plastics. One of the more obvious applications of this is ultra-lightweight armor and shielding - CNTs can possess 400 times the tensile strength of steel, yet only one-sixth the density. CNTs will thus be of particular benefit to humanity's conquest of the stars. It is believed that they could reduce craft weight by some 30%, while their astounding resilience and thermal deflection properties will greatly ease the pain of orbital re-entry, to name but one of the longstanding problems now potentially solved. There is, in addition, significant potential for the containment of volatile energies, as CNTs are also highly chemically- and radiation-resistant. Wide-scale implementation of carbon nanotubes will be a true game-changer for humanity's future.

TITechTemplate.description.CleanEnergy=In many ways, every single one of our incredible discoveries made since we first discovered that we are not alone in the universe has led to this. Boundless energy, meeting humanity's every need for decades, perhaps even centuries to come, but without harming the world or the skies around us. As much as we look to other worlds, Earth is our home, and one in need of protection - from ourselves, perhaps more than any other threat. Fusion fuel - specifically, a further refinement of Deuterium-Helium-3 fusion - is key here, as it steps away from any need for steam and turbines, in favor of solid energy collectors, constructed from emission-free nanomaterials, and also releases no neutron radiation. Ultra-dense Deuterium, laser-compressed to be over 100x times as dense as our previous fusion fuel pellets, enables the generation of vast amounts of clean, safe power from the smallest of sources, and can be easily-transported effectively anywhere we might wish. But an age of clean energy for all is a matter of policy as much as it is a matter of technology. These fusion solutions must be shared with all human society, with the poorest nations and colonies as well as the wealthiest, rather than hidden behind a walled garden of patents and licensing costs. Once we take this step, we will at last be able to begin the healing of our suffering homeworld.

But reversing the changes - the shrinking ice shelves, the floods and the droughts, the unstable inland weather - caused by decades of fossil fuel usage and industrial farming will require further action. Our climate scientists have devised a raft of measures to ameliorate the issues and to gradually bring down Earth's temperature. These include so-called "space clouds:" releasing floods of one-micron particles into the stratosphere, where they will reflect a portion of sunlight, and thus enable the planet to cool. Additionally, our research into biotech and cybernetics now enables the creation of artificial trees, which will scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere far more efficiently than can our diminished rainforests. These are the culmination of our prior breakthroughs in almost every field, and they will ensure that our world is fit for human life for centuries, even millennia to come.

TITechTemplate.description.Coilguns=A superficially similar, but nevertheless distinct, electromagnetic weapon to railguns, the coilgun (or Gauss Rifle, named for the great German mathematician), once again rewrites what was previously thought possible. Coilguns as a concept have existed for decades, but until now they have struggled to match the kinetic force of even an airgun. Thanks to further refinement of the electromagnetic technologies used in our mass drivers, this limitation has evaporated. While a railgun operates by passing current along one side of its barrel and then back down the other, our newest weapon houses an array of coils along its length, which are turned on and off in rapid and precise sequence, creating powerful electromagnetic attraction that accelerates projectiles to incredible velocities.<br/><br/>Essentially, the coils rapidly pull projectiles through their center, whereas a railgun pushes its slugs along the rails in its barrel with great force. Railguns suffer from extreme wear and tear as a result, which imposes certain limitations on how powerful they can be without tearing themselves apart. A coilgun's coils, by contrast, do not come into physical contact with their projectiles, which in turn enables us to feed them far greater amounts of electrical power, without the same likelihood of reduced efficiency or eventual self-destruction.<br/><br/>In short, a railgun is the brute force approach to electromagnetic warfare, while a coilgun is a costlier but far more refined solution. Used correctly, it is a truly devastating weapon.

TITechTemplate.description.ColonyHabs=Now that we are able to safely settle significant numbers of personnel on other worlds, the push towards full colonization can begin. In time, our neighboring planets can become true homes to humanity, rather than mere outposts. As terraforming remains an impossible dream, we cannot hope to bestow a breathable atmosphere upon other worlds - as such, our colonies remain restricted to pressurized domes and underground tunnels. It is the latter that will house the population, in order to protect them from the radiation of cosmic rays and solar proton storms. The limitation until now has been providing sufficient openness to support a growing population, as well as the need for massive shipments of construction materials from Earth. Thanks to developments in space mining and orbital construction, we are at last able to build, transport, and install enormous, modular subterranean chambers that - unlike the cramped corridors of yore - provide both individuals and families with sufficient space and privacy. Meanwhile, heated surface domes grow crops, and vast man-made ice fields provide water at scale. This is an undertaking like never before, and all who choose to join these colonies must learn to live without many of the comforts of humanity's homeworld, but our engineers and architects all agree: large-scale, multi-generational planetary colonies are finally possible. From these, we can eventually expand to the outer planets - and beyond.

Optical and cranial augmentations granting instantaneous, 24/7 access to all the knowledge one might ever need, a consistent state of augmented reality, and even the potential for humanity to become a fully-networked species. Meanwhile, our bodies can be improved, to become stronger, more resilient and capable of feats once considered the lurid fantasies of superhero fiction.

Our current spacecraft and engines are capable of no such thing, at least not for any useful length of time; the major stumbling block is fuel, with our current sources constrained both by storage and propulsion limitations. It is a problem the world's finest engineers and physicists have long labored to solve, and they now believe that a pathway to next-generation propulsion systems is open to us. Efficiency is the foremost avenue of their exploration - increasing the speed and longevity of propellant, while reducing wear and damage to our ships' drives and nozzles. Now that the essential concepts are established, our researchers believe there are three possible paths to tread: electromagnetic, electrostatic, or electrothermal propulsion. Each has its own advantage and will depend upon prior discoveries in other fields.

TITechTemplate.description.DeuteriumDeuteriumFusion=With just the naked eye (presuming we are far enough away from artificial light sources), we can glimpse millions of stars, burning in far distant galaxies. Their enduring fire is the end-product of multiple fusion reactions deep within their rolling mass of plasma. For decades, science has sought the key that would unlock this boundless energy source, and enable us to replicate it within a lab. But until now, we have been unable to contain the extreme temperatures and pressures required to safely generate and sustain man-made stars.<br/><br/>Now, however, our engineers have achieved the previously impossible - a reactor that can hold the power of a protostar, kept in check by a combination of superconducting magnets and experimental nanomaterials. A protostar's power stems from its capability to fuse two deuterium atoms - or burning deuterium - to helium3. While the young star uses its mass and gravity to reach the necessary extreme conditions for such a process, our reactors press the fuel together using magnetic and electric fields, as well as lasers.<br/><br/>With the power of a tiny sun burning in the heart of our every spaceship and habitat, we will be able to reach and colonize the farthest reaches of our solar system.

TITechTemplate.description.DeuteriumHelium3Fusion=If we wish to stand equal to other star-faring races, we must continue to overcome the limitations of our current technology. One of the foremost such limitations has, for the longest time, been the amount of radioactive material created by our reactors. But now, building upon our knowledge of advanced electromagnetic fields and deuterium-tritium fusion reactors, we have finally overcome this problem. <br/><br/>Unlike our prior fusion reactors, the deuterium-helium-3 fusion process does not produce neutron radiation. Its lone high-energy reaction product, a proton, can be easily captured by our electric and magnetic fields, enabling us to harness its momentum with solid energy collectors. By moving away from heating water and creating steam to run turbines, this new reactor technology can reach unprecedented efficiency - and in turn power a new generation of spaceships and habitats, faster and larger (respectively) than before. <br/><br/>Even this breakthrough is a mere stepping stone towards our ultimate goal: truly harnessing the power of the sun.

TITechTemplate.description.DeuteriumTritiumFusion=By building upon our knowledge of nuclear fusion technologies and nuclear fission processes, we have been able to turn the greatest disadvantage of fusing two hydrogen isotopes, namely deuterium and tritium, into its greatest benefit. On paper, the neutron radiation created by this fusion reaction is deeply undesirable. However, our researchers have designed a reactor chamber that generates a measure of its own fuel through an engineering marvel called a <i>tritium breeding blanket</i>.<br/><br/>While deuterium - rare as it is - can still be harvested from seawater or other hydrogen sources in space, its radioactive brother, tritium, has to be created through bombarding lithium with neutrons. By designing a lithium layered coating - the breeding blanket - on the inside of the reactor chamber, we can use the neutrons released during the fusion to create new tritium fuel, while the reactor is running.<br/> This novel and effective design will allow this reactor to last longer and with less fuel consumption than any other reactor design so far. At the same time, it can protect spaceships and habitats alike from the dangers of neutron radiation. And yet, our journey to harness fusion energy is far from over. This success paves the way for other fusion concepts, such fusing deuterium with itself, or reaching further by fusing helium and deuterium.

Diamondoids exist in nature already, first discovered in 1933 as hydrocarbon clusters extracted from crude oil. Their remarkable rigidity as well as thermal and chemical stability, has long made them a source of scientific curiosity, but with the successful synthesis of diamondoids in the lab, the incredible now becomes possible. With the mass production of this nanomolecule, we can create a diamond-like substance 50 times stronger than steel, but its exceptional purity means it sheds all of diamonds' flaws - not to mention the cost. This is no mere armor plating.

TITechTemplate.description.DirectedEnergyWarfareDoctrine=Warfare has existed since the dawn of humankind. Our most devastating weapons and strategies were born in times of drastic change and uncertainty. Never has that been more true than today.<br/><br/>While they might liberate us from the need for projectiles, our initial laser weapons remain relatively weak despite their huge energy needs, and thus it is critical that we evolve the technology behind them. These rays, made either of extremely intense light or highly focused particle beams, will circumvent traditional armor and burn organic matter. More than anything, this is a matter of efficiency - less heat and less dissipation over distance means harder-hitting impacts.<br/><br/>The particle cannons and combat laser systems that we believe further research into energy weapons will birth may drastically change the landscape of warfare - not only in space, but also here on Earth.

TITechTemplate.description.DirectedSpaceResearch=Our research into how to support human existence in space and on neighboring worlds continues apace, but true progress will only come once we think beyond the rudiments - not only how to survive, but how to become something more. How can we turn micro-gravity to our advantage? How will society best function when the vast and empty void, rather than land, separates our species? How can we study what lies beyond our own solar system? What can we learn from the aliens themselves, from their biology and their technology? How do we protect our cosmic interests from current and future threats? These are just some of the many questions our scientists are keen to answer. Leaving Earth's orbit en masse will be the single greatest endeavor in human history: only through science can we truly make a success of it.

TITechTemplate.displayName.ElectromagneticPropulsion=Electromagnetic Propulsion
TITechTemplate.summary.ElectromagneticPropulsion=Physicists design rockets that use electromagnetic fields to accelerate propellant.
TITechTemplate.quote.ElectromagneticPropulsion="Science would tell us that we are nothing more than vibrating atoms. 'Everything in life is vibration,' as Einstein put it.

TITechTemplate.description.ElectromagneticPropulsion=Since the dawn of the rocket age, our efforts to reach space have been limited to chemical propulsion, and all the inherent inefficiency and risk that entails. It is to electromagnetics that we now look instead, essentially jolting our craft through space. This is thanks to a curious quality in electromagnets that sees them vibrate when cooled to very low temperatures. While that is in itself scarcely a new discovery, a breakthrough, which enables us to contain this vibration then send it in a specific direction very much is. When applied to experimental, supercooled, superconducting magnets, made to vibrate some 400,000 times per second, this 'jolt' can carry our spacefaring craft further and faster than chemical-based methods. With further refinement, this form of propulsion could see our craft potentially reach 1% of the speed of light. An unimpressive figure on paper, perhaps, but in practice it is a significant leap forward.

TITechTemplate.description.ElectrostaticPlasmaConfinement=By utilizing static electric fields to contain a fusion reaction, this form of fusion power directly heats its fuel, bypassing most of the energy loss found in other types of fusion power, and making it compatible with aneutronic fuels. These fuels permit fusion to occur without producing harmful ionizing radiation, in turn reducing biological risks when handling fuel and materials, as well as improving longevity of equipment. The relatively simple nature of turning charged particles into power makes this method of particular interest for power systems.

TITechTemplate.description.ElectrostaticPropulsion=Of the many factors that have kept humanity tethered to our home planet since we first sent a man to space all those decades ago, the foremost is fuel demands. Any deep space propulsion system needs to manage its fuel as efficiently as possible to allow for long distance travel.<br/><br/>Now, by using electrostatic fields, our researchers believe they have found a workable solution. This novel thruster concept employs an elegant array of electrostatic fields to guide and accelerate the fuel. The fuel is pushed through an almost frictionless system of pipes to gain velocity. Once it has reached the desired velocity, the fuel is expelled through thrusters, pushing the spaceship forward. The beauty of these thrusters is the tunability of the electrostatic fields, which allows the spacecraft to select just the right amount of acceleration for any maneuver. Even though the current design allows accurate control over the spaceship's thrust, our engineers believe that, in time, we will be able to push the fuel velocity even further using high-energy electrostatic fields.

TITechTemplate.description.ElectrothermalPropulsion=Truly traveling among the stars has been an unreachable fantasy for mankind for many decades. However, with the invention of high-power electromagnets and superconductors, and the advent of new concepts for deep space propulsion, this dream draws ever closer to reality. Our researchers have finally made good upon one of these concepts: electrothermal propulsion.<br/><br/>This rocket design offers faster and more powerful thrust than any conventional combustion system. By using electromagnetic fields to generate an energetic plasma, we can significantly increase the temperature of bulk propellant. The propellant turns into hot gas, which is in turn ejected from a craft's nozzle to create thrust. All our current designs use medium-weight molecules, but our scientists believe that, by changing the propellant to lighter gases such as hydrogen or helium, we can ultimately increase the range of these rockets even further. These expected high-energy electrothermal propulsion systems would allow us to extend our reach deeper into the solar system.

TITechTemplate.description.ExtendedSpaceSurvival=Long-term existence beyond Earth's atmosphere creates problems far beyond the simple need for oxygen and food. Extended space-flight is terrible for the human body, not least due to microgravity. We have been able to mitigate this to some extent, but dealing with it in the longer term requires a more aggressive response. Over the months and years, muscles atrophy, bones become brittle, eyesight deteriorates, and even the effects of ageing are accelerated. Then there is prolonged exposure to radiation, and the more minor, yet still aggravating risks of deformed fingernails, kidney stones, and gout. This is not to mention the psychological effects: the simultaneous loneliness and lack of privacy as well as the constant, gnawing terror of a systems failure or hull breach.<br/><br/>The same issues will perpetuate even on land, should we settle on planets with no or minimal atmospheres. Thus, if human society is to exist either off-world or in planetary colonies, all of these problems must be solved. Thankfully, we now have proposals for a raft of easily mass-produced treatments, supplements, and technologies to mitigate the worst of these effects in the short term and, in the longer term, to breed a next generation of future spacefarers who are biologically more resistant to the sheer brutality of life in space.

TITechTemplate.description.FallofEmpires=For millennia, Earth has been divided into sprawling kingdoms. Some fall, others rise, others merge or fracture; the great and slow wave of change cannot be turned back even in more conventional times. No matter how great a world power may once have been, it cannot hope to survive the seismic transformations brought about by the absolute certainty that we are not alone, and the inevitable expansion of humanity far beyond historical borders of land and sea. If we are to survive all that is to come, we must accelerate this decline. These ancient and unwieldy empires only hold us back, for they are ships too slow to turn, and the few who lead them cannot possibly reflect the needs and desires of the many. Now that the fragmentation of smaller nations into independent states has begun in earnest, it is time to fell the giants, to dismantle the old regimes so that their people are free and nimble enough to chart their own course into tomorrow. Whether the new powers that will rise from the ashes are robust enough to usher the children of Earth through the many challenges the galaxy will present them remains to be seen...

TITechTemplate.description.FissionPulseDrives=Riding into space on nuclear explosions was proposed as early as 1947 - long before we knew that we were not alone in the universe. However, we lacked the advanced materials to contain and effectively direct the violently explosive power required for a successful launch.<br/><br/>Now, by using our solid core nuclear fuel and ultra-strong nanomaterials, we have at last designed a spaceship drive that employs small, directed nuclear blasts as its propellant. Crucially, this occurs with only minimal radioactive fallout when used near the Earth's atmosphere. Each detonation is directed by a cannon-type exhaust in the propulsion module of the spaceship, so that the full force of the explosion hits the absorber plate. This plate is equipped with shock-absorbing nanomaterials that transfer the force of the blast to the rest of the ship as smooth, sustained acceleration, sufficiently so that reaching the further-flung moons and planets of our solar system becomes significantly more feasible.<br/><br/>It may also be that, by merging this latest breakthrough with our prior research on molten and gas core fission, even more advanced pulse systems will soon be possible.

TITechTemplate.description.FleetLogistics=Our solar system should not be thought of as merely some larger version of our world; it is a vast expanse of space, unbound by border and landmass. The practicalities of patrolling and securing it, whether from threats beyond or threats within, are far beyond anything ever experienced on Earth. In even the rawest form, it requires more ships, and more ships means more coordination and more maintenance. Thus, our next move is to ensure ships can take care of themselves - and each other - rather than being wholly dependent upon distant stations to repair and restore them. The proposals are ready now, and only once they are actioned can our ships truly hope to survive whatever unexpected slings and arrows the galaxy might throw at them.

TITechTemplate.description.GasCoreFissionSystems=Molten core fission systems still rely on heat conversion and turbines to generate electricity or thrust, which is not the most efficient way to harness power.<br/><br/>Our new gas core fission systems use gaseous uranium hexafluoride as fuel, contained within the reaction chamber using superconducting magnets. Thanks to this powerful yet precise containment field, the fission reaction never touches the chamber walls. This enables us to place highly-efficient solid-state energy collectors around the reactions and thus capture their energy. These collectors transform the electromagnetic radiation and charged particles from fission reactions directly into electricity.<br/><br/>Additionally, this reactor design uses gaseous hydrogen as both reactor coolant and propellant - igniting it within the reactor chamber and pushing it out through the drive cone. As with prior breakthroughs, gas core fission enables more sustainable habitats far away from Earth, as well as more powerful spaceship drives. Even so, this is far from the end of the road for fission-based technologies.

One capable of feats of both strength and intellect beyond anything our species has ever before attained. One that, if we so will it, is little short of superhuman. This is possible now not only due to our countless breakthroughs in the field of genetics, but also in machine learning - for only a machine could map and then edit the 6 billion characters that make up an entire human genome, time and again.

TITechTemplate.description.GreatNations=The greater the divisions between the nations of the world, the greater the potential for someone - or something - to exploit them. Discord only makes us weaker, at a time when all the peoples of the world should stand together in the face of seismic change. It is time to put the petty conflicts of yesteryear aside, and for states and nations to group together into new super-powers, with the resources and togetherness required both to adapt to the alien dawn and to successfully colonize neighboring worlds. While no nation wants to give up its culture or history, there are those who are inherently sympathetic to each other and those inherently allied against the creeds of others. The right policies and the right treaties would ensure national identities are respected even as borders crumble. Lessons too must be learned from the past, if we are to avoid the disruptive nationalist movements and extreme partisanship of recent decades.<br/><br/>The road to these super-states will not be an easy one; there will need to be untold referendums and elections, not to mention chaos in the financial sector and from newly-unbound freedom of movement. But the end will justify the torturous means. The alien arrival - visitors from not just another nation, but another world entirely - means that traditional geographical boundaries have lost almost all relevance. Continent-wide super-nations sharing a singular vision, thus representing our greatest hope of facing down tyranny - whether from elsewhere in our world, or from others far beyond it.

TITechTemplate.description.HeavyPulsedPropulsion=When Project Orion - the first attempt to conceptualize a starship powered by atomic explosions - began in 1958, it was considered to be the longest of shots. However, since realizing the first fission pulse drive, we have refined its design and overcome countless limitations, both foreseen and unforeseen.<br/><br/>Our new heavy pulsed propulsion system combines the raw power of nuclear bombs with the energy efficiency and precision of our advanced fission systems. By generating energy through the dual-core principle of the advanced fission system, we can use the molten core circuit for precise maneuvering of our spacecraft, while the nuclear pulse drive provides powerful thrust for rapid travel between worlds. The drive system has been upgraded to include a new delivery method and absorber plate, which grants near-perfect control of each nuclear blast, transforming its vast and destructive force into smooth, sustained acceleration.<br/><br/>This heavy pulsed propulsion drive is the crowning jewel of nuclear rocket science. It may even take us beyond the borders of our own solar system and see us rise to become equals in the eyes of those who dwell there.

TITechTemplate.description.HighEnergyElectromagneticPropulsion=With electromagnetic propulsion now a proven success, we can explore how to refine it further. In the simplest terms, feeding an electromagnet more power can create even faster 'jolts', which we then use to propel our craft through space at greater speeds, but the inherent danger here is destroying the magnet in the process. If the vibration is too rapid, it will simply tear itself apart. Fortunately, our researchers have been able to perfect far more resilient magnets without their becoming too unwieldy. This second generation is approximately one foot across, and fed by a hockey puck-sized, solid-state switch that mediates the electricity sent to it, converting it into the rapid pulses required to make the magnet vibrate. So sturdy and so capable is this new propulsion system that it can be paired with spacecraft drives of incredible power without risk, and could even be the heart of next-generation mass drivers, able to transport resources further and faster than before.

TITechTemplate.description.HighEnergyElectrostaticPropulsion=Our solar system is a treasure trove of resources that will help us become the space-faring race we are surely destined to be. This does not remove the need for human ingenuity, of course. So it is to a further evolution of electrostatic propulsion systems that we now look, as we seek to explore the furthest corners of the sol system - and, perhaps, beyond.<br/><br/>This new thruster concept is based on our existing electrostatic drives, but employs far stronger fields in combination with a lighter, ionized propellant. The latter can be accelerated faster and to significantly greater maximum velocities; while the strengthened fields also have a smaller footprint, allowing for more compact drive design. Ships equipped with these new thrusters will comfortably exceed the current limitations of space travel.

TITechTemplate.description.HighEnergyElectrothermalPropulsion=Until now, our current spacecraft had only limited reach, allowing us only to explore our nearest neighbors; however, high-energy electrothermal propulsion will help us to extend our influence into the farthest corners of this solar system.<br/><br/>Based on existing electrothermal drives, our researchers have refined the electromagnetic containment fields, allowing us to supercharge the plasma. These new containment fields are able to directly weave the supercharged plasma through the light-weight propellant. This creates a highly energetic flow of gas within the nozzle system. By using a new fully frictionless coating, the gas flow can reach far higher velocities than the previous generation. These higher velocities translate directly into more powerful thrust, while offering precise directional control - exactly what is needed to make exploration of the outer planets feasible.

TITechTemplate.description.HighEnergyLasers=For generations, laser weapons have been a science-fiction staple, but their development for military application has been hampered not purely by their extreme energy requirements, but also thermal blooming. A laser heats the air it passes through, and the subsequent change in air density in turn causes a continued beam to defocus and lose strength. To compound the problem, the beam will bend towards cooler air, which has blighted previous prototypes with poor accuracy.<br/><br/>The most obvious response is to further concentrate the beam, but this simply makes the air around it even hotter, and thus perpetuates the issue.<br/><br/>At last, however, scientists have been able to perfect lasers, which fire in brief, high-power pulses rather than a sustained "ray." While thermal blooming is not an issue in the airless vacuum of space, light (and therefore strength) dissipation over great distances very much still is. As we develop next-generation energy technologies, far more devastating laser weapons for use both within and beyond our skies will become eminently possible.

TITechTemplate.description.HighTemperatureSuperconductors=Superconductors are substances that transmit electricity without resistance, and therefore, without energy loss. They are thus essential for the extreme energy requirements of the groundbreaking technologies humanity has developed in response to the alien arrival. Alas, superconductors are historically limited to very low temperatures. For decades, even our most pioneering ones could only function below -220F. It was not until the early 2020s that superconductivity even at room temperatures became possible, achieved by forming a crystalline compound of carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur, but even then its applications were infuriatingly limited. At last, however, we have developed a compound capable of superconductivity even at the high temperatures found in harsher extrasolar environments, and with only minimal energy loss. An equally important breakthrough is effective shielding from the magnetic fields so fundamental to our spacecraft and their weaponry, but so disruptive to superconductivity. This offers astounding potential for even greater advancements in deep-space propulsion and combat.

Both hydrogen and lithium are abundant resources in our solar system. By using our understanding of lithium from our nuclear fission and weapons research, we can create the first generation of hydrogen-lithium-6 fusion reactors.<br/><br/>Fusing hydrogen with lithium involves an aneutronic reaction, the benefit of which is that we can collect the energy using water and turbines, since it is mostly released as electromagnetic radiation rather than neutrons. Converting this electromagnetic radiation into electricity is far easier than trying to capture neutrons. In addition, our reactors can forgo the heavy neutron shielding required to protect all living matter in the vicinity, making them lighter and smaller than previous generations.<br/><br/>We can in turn then build faster and lighter ships, which will aid our expansion deeper into the solar system.

TITechTemplate.description.ImprovedShipbuildingTechniques=No matter the craft, and no matter its engine, mass is the foremost obstacle to efficient space travel. The more matter there is to move, the slower it will move - but less mass need not necessarily mean smaller ships. Indeed, it is larger ships we require, to transport more resources and to carry more crew and more colonists. The best approach here is to greenlight designs for orbit-to-orbit craft, which do not land on any planet, moon or asteroid. This removes the need for landing gear, ablative heat-shielding, large wings, and the countless other specialized equipment required for take-off and landing, and thus enables far larger cargo and habitat areas. Shuttles will ferry personnel and cargo to and from our stations and colonies, while strategically-placed fuel and propellant depots further reduce what the ships need to carry themselves. In combination with advances in more lightweight materials, the net result is we can build far larger craft than ever before, without unduly impacting their ability to travel between worlds.

Water is the foremost essential, as it can be separated into oxygen and hydrogen, which in turn can be used for creation of fuel, propellant, and a breathing mix for personnel and plants - not to mention also serving as coolant and radiation shielding. Fortunately, we are now confident that we can obtain sufficient water from the ever-shadowed poles of Luna, our own moon, in combination with mining it from asteroids.

TITechTemplate.description.IndustrializationofSpace=There is almost no prospect of exploring, let alone settling, the further-flung depths of our solar system until we can free ourselves from a dependence upon Earth-based supply lines. We must be able to produce all that we need for ships, colonies, and mining facilities locally - which is to say, in space rather than solely upon a planet's surface. There is an abundance of minerals beyond Earth's orbit, some of which we can currently mine, and some of which we cannot. We now have plans for effective micro- and zero-g factories that can function with a relatively minimal human presence, able to turn the raw materials of asteroids and moons into almost anything we might create on Earth (including more such factories), often at a fraction of the cost, but at many times the scale. Yet this is not only a matter of production, but also of trade and transport - laws and treaties that dictate what is shared with whom, for what cost, and via which approve shipping routes. Space is no longer some cosmic frontier town: it is time that it became a thriving and essential part of our economy.

TITechTemplate.description.InertialPlasmaConfinementTechniques=By applying energy evenly across the surface of its fuel pellet, high-energy lasers force the outer layer of the fuel to explode, meet its resistance, and reverse its direction inwards. The resultant compression shockwaves compress the fuel to the point of creating a fusion reaction. Interestingly, our biggest strides in this field were not in the reaction itself, but in adapting materials to contain the fusion reaction over the long term. Changes in heat-dissipation techniques, as well as innovative means to dispose of radioactive neutrons, have made inertial confinement fusion a viable option for keeping up with the ever-increasing energy demands of a space-faring species.

TITechTemplate.description.InfraredCombatLasers=Since the invention of the device for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation," otherwise known as the laser, in 1960, our scientists have developed many ways to harness the power of light. Now, we have reached another milestone in the history of lasers: the first infrared combat laser.<br/><br/>This weaponized laser system uses tightly-focused, extremely intense infrared light pulses to burn through most known materials. It is only due to the coherence - both in space and time - of laser light that we are able to bundle it so efficiently. These lasers use solid-state crystal rods to generate ultra-short pulses of infrared light. Through laser seeding technology, in which we use a smaller laser to shape the larger laser pulse, we can generate reliable infrared pulses with the same power output.<br/><br/>Even though laser systems can be precisely aimed, the infrared light dissipates over long distances, making this weapon most effective in short to medium range combat. Due to the long wavelength of infrared lasers, they are not very effective within our planet's atmosphere. However, our scientists see the potential for new combat laser designs using visible light in our future, which would significantly increase their versatility.

TITechTemplate.description.IntegratedEarthSpaceEconomy=The balance of power has, perhaps inevitably, shifted. Where once our space pioneers were dependent on Earth's support to survive, now humanity all but depends upon the resources and technologies that only the hardy denizens of space, and the other worlds, can provide. And so the deal must change, lest - as Earth's history dictates - there will be first resentment, and then conflict. The time has come to declare that our remote colonies are vassals and glorified factories no longer, and instead shall henceforth be treated as equal partners, no longer beholden to our demands and each given their own place at the negotiating table. Only once humanity's every distant offshoot works and trades in harmony will we be ready for what our brave new future holds.

TITechTemplate.description.InterplanetaryPolities=If there is one lesson to be learned from the history of human society's colonization of distant lands, it is that remote rule proves only sustainable under absolute tyranny, and all that bloodshed that entails. A growing desire for independence from a far-off homeland is inevitable, and conflict in the pursuit of it a given. This will be just as true for our off-world colonies as it was for America and Africa centuries ago. If we do not establish a workable solution now, Earth-bound humanity and space-based humanity may well become locked in a cold war spanning light years. The need, then, is to establish policies, laws, and systems by which our colonies are beholden to their homeworld (particularly in terms of sharing off-world resources with it), yet free to make their own day-to-day decisions, choose their own leaders and defend their own borders.<br/><br/>No matter the breakthroughs we might make in the speed of data transfer, it seems unlikely that we will cross the light barrier within the near future. For governance to depend upon on waiting for answers that take hours, days or weeks to arrive would be a slow suicide for both sides. If we are to remain one humanity, even as we slowly spread across the cosmos, we must ensure our colonies are self-sufficient, content, and therefore, loyal now, not later.

TITechTemplate.description.KineticsWarfareDoctrine=The next frontier in space warfare is magnetic weaponry, lending velocity to a round not via combustion, but via electromagnetic acceleration. Even despite there being no air to slow a gunpowder-based bullet's passage, such rounds simply cannot reach the speeds required to effectively punch through an armored hull at great range. Magnetic weapons overcome this limitation (and replace explosive-based rounds with far cheaper, yet potentially larger, solid metal slugs) by 'pushing' their rounds through an electromagnetically-charged barrel, thus imparting far more kinetic energy upon their rounds at the moment of firing. The result is harder-hitting weapons, requiring only an electrical power source to function. With proof of this concept now established, additional breakthroughs in the field of magnetics will enable us to develop powerful, spacecraft-mounted railguns. Ultimately, we also hope to replace metal slugs with energy-based rounds.

TITechTemplate.description.MagneticForceManipulation=Human fascination with magnetism dates backs millennia, from the ancient Greeks where the name is derived, to descriptions in the <I>Sushruta Samhita</I> where lodestones are used to remove arrows from wounded soldiers. While we have been able to create magnets, or empower existing ones, it is only now that we are able to actively influence the direction and amplitude of that force. By exerting control on the magnetic force itself, we will be able to control increasingly dangerous reactions and materials. Advances in this field will allow us to pursue several distinct avenues of theoretical energy production and confinement.

TITechTemplate.summary.MagneticNozzles=Using shaped magnetic fields as rocket nozzles will unlock a new generation of high-power drives.

All they can do is move close enough to influence each other."<br/><align=right>{cooperateLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>From a guest lecture at the University of Cambridge<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.MagneticNozzles=A magnetic nozzle serves the same purpose as a solid nozzle, which is to say it ejects a plasma jet into the vacuum of space in order to achieve propulsion. However, it achieves this contactlessly, and thus avoids the inefficiency and system damage inherent to forcing hot, high-pressure plasma along the walls of a solid nozzle. This new form of nozzle operates by using electromagnetic fields to magnetize the electrons within the plasma, confining their expansion while guiding them downstream, where ultimately their internal energy is efficiently converted into directed kinetic energy. All of this has for some time been feasible to a limited degree in the lab, but it is only now, thanks to our remarkable breakthroughs in electromagnetics, that we can now make magnetic nozzles feasible within the confines of a spacecraft. Thanks to their dramatically increased thrust, efficiency, longevity, and low mass, new and far more powerful types of drive and reactor can become a reality.

TITechTemplate.description.MagneticPlasmaConfinementTechniques=Plasma consists of charged particles — specifically, positive nuclei and negative electrons — that can be shaped and confined by magnetic forces. Like iron filings subjected to magnets, these particles will follow a magnetic field's guidance, enabling us to both contain and direct the boiling, deadly forces within. The magnetic field lines act like an invisible bottle, and can isolate the plasma from any solid walls around it, thus preventing it from burning right through them. Magnetically-confined plasmas can reach temperatures ten times hotter than the heart of the sun, and as such could be used to generate untold megawatts of energy - whether that be to accelerate a spacecraft to ever-greater velocities, or to deal unstoppable death to our enemies.

TITechTemplate.description.MassDrivers=No matter the technological advancements we might yet make, our ability to voyage through the stars will be inherently limited by what the human body can endure. Mined resources are not, however, at risk of liquefied internal organs during high-speed space transit. Mass Drivers employ electromagnetic acceleration to essentially hurl unmanned cargo through space at breathtaking speeds, charging and then firing their payloads in the manner of a catapult. Albeit one fueled by vast amounts of electricity and capable of firing its shots across millions of kilometers.<br/><br/>While mass drivers are not a new concept, our latest breakthroughs enable us to instantaneously feed them far greater quantities of energy than ever before, thus enabling the rapid, long-distance transport of exponentially greater masses. The most immediate practical application of Mass Drivers is to ferry essential and precious materials mined from asteroids and other heavenly bodies back to Earth with a minimum of delay. This technology will bring about a sea-change in our ability to replenish and grow our local resource stores. Further research should be able to refine and even miniaturize the concepts behind mass drivers, in the hope of integrating them into weapons capable of truly devastating punch.

TITechTemplate.description.MindandMachine=Cybernetics and artificial intelligence have, until now, represented parallel forks of humanity's technological evolution.

Minds that can out-calculate a super-computer, with the ability to understand and analyze any situation, any threat in an instant. The leap that has made this possible, as opposed to the faltering and unreliable approaches of the past, is not ease of use and safety, but rather the development of software-based intelligence that truly understands how humans think, and thus can effectively parse the endless stream of data into primarily sensory information that we can innately understand. Some may use the outmoded term 'cyborg' to describe the human test subjects that will result from the new, prototype neural implants and cranial interfaces born of this breakthrough, but in truth they will make us so much more than that - and so much more than human.

TITechTemplate.description.MissileWarfareDoctrine=Even as we explore new forms of weapons with which to protect our interests in space, we would be foolish to abandon the humble missile. While a missile can be out-run or dodged far more easily than most other weapons, it has the singular advantage that it can pursue an enemy craft, and will deliver the same payload regardless of distance. In order to successfully overwhelm any point-defense system intended to ward off our missiles, our engineers have focused their efforts in two directions. The first is mass; our ships will need to carry many, many missiles, so a new, lightweight construction mitigates that issue somewhat. Secondly, there is computing and targeting; we will need systems to ensure that our missiles fire and converge from multiple and unpredictable directions, and 'understand' which areas of a ship to best target. By comparison, our new missiles' multispectral guidance systems proved relatively straightforward. It is, after all, hard to lose track of something as noisy (in terms of thermal, visual, and radio output) as a manned spacecraft.

TITechTemplate.description.MissiontoJupiter=Jupiter itself is an impossible target for colonization, being it is a gas giant. There is no real surface on which to land craft or build infrastructure, and the radiation and gravity are antithetical even to the construction of floating stations. Its dozens of moons are another matter entirely. It is the four known as the Galilean satellites that are considered our best prospects for larger-scale settlement - and as a staging ground for further expansion. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are large enough and solid enough to support infrastructure, although most are nevertheless extremely hostile to life. Jupiter's gravity is fierce, while its radiation belt, which blasts Io and Europa, is approximately a million times more deadly than Earth's; an inadequately protected human would, sadly, perish within days of arrival. However, breakthroughs in super-dense shielding will make some degree of long-term habitation possible.<br/><br/>Callisto, however, exists outside the Van Allen belt, and thus would require comparatively minimal anti-radiation measures. The similarly icy Europa and Ganymede remain worthwhile targets, due to the presence of subsurface oceans, and the potential to create artificial air pockets far below the frozen surface. The dry, turbulent Io is a far less appealing prospect; however, its volcanic environment could be a potent source of energy and rare minerals as we strive to reach the outer worlds.

TITechTemplate.description.MissiontoMars=Though it is scarcely an appealing home, there is no better prospect within our solar system for eventual colonization than our crimson neighbor, Mars. It lacks a breathable atmosphere, the radiation risk from both galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles is extreme, the soil is flooded with toxins, and the low gravity will weaken both bones and muscles and cause cardiovascular problems. Then there is the cold, and the minimal supply of water... And with travel each way also taking months, at least until such time as we have made profound progress in spaceflight technology, only the bravest and hardiest pioneers would dare take this chance. Yet if humanity is ever to explore the stars, or settle on further-out planets, or to trace our alien visitors to their own homeworld, there is simply no choice other than Mars. In terms of temperature, sunlight, and simple proximity, no other planet in our system comes close. Our scientists are now confident that the settling of a limited number of highly-trained personnel will be possible, thanks to a combination of highly complex life-support systems and certain cyanobacteria capable of photosynthesis even on Mars' hostile surface. The latter, grown at sufficient scale, can generate both food and oxygen locally, and allow the propagation of more complex organisms. It is from these starting blocks that long-term life on Mars will begin.

TITechTemplate.description.MissiontotheInnerPlanets=Full colonization of the inner worlds of our solar system must remain a pipe dream, for neither the alternately burning and freezing landscape of Mercury nor the acidic atmosphere of Venus could possibly support more than the briefest human existence. However, there is some hope for limited settlement in the permanently shadowed craters which litter Mercury's poles, which we believe also contain copious amounts of frozen water. But the true gain in enabling our fleets to reach the sun's closest planet would be its sheer abundance of resources. Some 70% of Mercury is composed of metal. As for Venus, though its poison air and extreme heat would annihilate any life foolish enough to land upon it, in other respects it is Earth's close twin. As such, it could theoretically provide vast amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for the construction and maintenance of nearby space stations. Venus is also a rich source of deuterium, a potent fusion fuel. All of these will surely be necessary if we are to defend our home system from any threats, which might arise, and to expand further outwards.

TITechTemplate.description.MissiontoSaturn=Like its larger neighbor, Jupiter, the gaseous Saturn cannot support any infrastructure, let alone life. Although its considerable quantities of deuterium and helium-3 are of great interest as a fusion energy source. Some of the moons within the vast and icy rings of Saturn are extremely promising as a potential home for human life; however, particularly the largest, the aptly-named Titan, possesses all the elements required to sustain human life. Despite the extreme cold and the nitrogen-based atmosphere, there may be no better target for colonization in the entire solar system. The smaller Enceladus is also a prime candidate for long-term settlement. All of this is not even to mention that there is far less radiation in the Saturnian system than around Jupiter, and therefore, a far easier life for those who choose to dwell there. Saturn is a great and arduous distance to travel for sure, but as well as the abundance of resources and potentially inhabitable land, from Saturn's moons we can launch ourselves to the outer worlds and closer to wherever these extraterrestrials truly hail from.

TITechTemplate.description.MissionToSpace=Existing in space is a different animal than merely traversing it. If we plan to go from tourist to resident, we must adapt.

Likewise, our psychologists must develop a training regimen so personnel are able to maintain peak performance in an environment where "up" and "down" do not exist.<br/><br/>We have, of course, been able to travel into space for some time, but now we must establish how to do so easily, regularly, and cost-effectively, and in far greater numbers than ever before. This renewed mission to space thus entails a mission to change many of our most fundamental preconceptions. Yet all these hardships are entirely necessary, for only once we are comfortably beyond Earth's orbit can we hope to explore, exploit, and ultimately even settle upon neighboring worlds - and, in time, perhaps far beyond.

The rare earth metal deposits and water housed there would be of significant benefit to both lunar colonization and orbital construction efforts, freeing us from the need to expensively and slowly transport critical resources from Earth. The moon may not seem as enticing a trophy as Mars, Venus or beyond, but we would be foolish to squander the wondrous opportunities it presents us with.

Beyond Neptune's orbit is the Kuiper belt and the Outer Oort cloud, which contain billions, perhaps even trillions of ice-rich objects. We speculate that, amongst that great assembly, we will find all the ingredients required for life. The outer planets and beyond are also an abundant source of deuterium and helium-3 with which to meet our fuel needs - all the better to push even further outwards, and finally locate the origin of our alien visitors.

Another is biological: arranging specific strings of amino acids in order to assemble protein molecules, and therefore alter, or even create, living organisms. To do this, we will require vast, dedicated nanofactories, which our scientists now believe can be built by a single, self-replicating molecular assembler, thus almost wholly removing any dependence upon either personnel or resource shipments. Once these automated factories are established, the possibilities are near-endless.

TITechTemplate.description.MoltenCoreFissionSystems=Our current solid core fission reactors are reliant upon water and steam to generate electricity, which has proven to be an inherently inefficient design.<br/><br/>To address this shortcoming, the next generation of fission systems instead use both liquid fuels and molten metal as the coolant and heat absorber. These reactors are designed to generate - or breed - a portion of their fuel from a variety of sources, such as natural uranium and thorium, or even recycled radioactive waste and plutonium. The liquid fuel is a solution of these sources and molten salts, which slows the released neutrons of the fission reaction so that they can breed more fuel or sustain the chain reaction. The released energy is captured as heat through a second loop of molten lead as coolant. These reactors have two major benefits. First, they can generate more energy due to the high thermal conductivity of the metal coolant. Second, the lower operating pressures of both the fuel and the coolant make the design far safer than high-pressure water-cooled reactors.<br/><br/>These two advantages allow our spaceships and habitats to be safer. Together with their ability to breed portions of their fuel, these reactors can run longer on less fuel, opening a new pathway into the distant regions of the solar system. It is also the stepping stone to using gases as nuclear fuels, and developing even more advanced fission systems.

But these changed times, and our rapidly-changing world, require a dramatic evolution of even this so-called full-spectrum dominance. We must be able to respond to any threat that arises not only as one army, or one nation, or even one continent, but as one world. Using our many breakthroughs in quantum computing and communication, we can build defensive systems capable of instantaneous and lethal response, anywhere on the planet - and, indeed, anywhere in the skies above it.

TITechTemplate.description.NetworkedPropaganda=If not controlling, then at least influencing hearts and minds is a growing necessity in this most turbulent of ages. With old loyalties transformed and new sympathies forged by the alien arrival, international borders - or indeed planetary ones - simply will not present any barrier whatsoever to the spreading of a message. The advent of cybernetics offers startling opportunities in this field too - we are now testing experimental new implants that entirely remove the old need for devices and screens and cables, enabling the near-instantaneous sending and receipt of messages and videos to anyone, anywhere.<br/><br/>The potential for organizing movements, for crowd-sourced initiatives and for the mass coordination of aid to people in need is endless, but so too is the potential for exploitation. Not simply in terms of marketing and advertising - there are those who would use it to slowly, perniciously bend others to their will, to encourage coups or to destabilize their opponents through sustained, direct-to-the-senses misinformation campaigns. But this new era of mass communication is a genie that cannot be returned to its bottle - to the victor, the spoils.

TITechTemplate.description.NeutroniumContainment=The use of neutronium - the same as the material found at the core of a massive neutron star - as a potential energy source requires, first and foremost, the capability to recreate the intense gravity that first created it, else it would rapidly decay in a burst of deadly radiation. Once harnessed, it is this very burst that can provide incredible amounts of energy, but containment of such free neutrons has thus far eluded even our brightest minds. However, our scientists now believe that they can build upon their work in ultra-dense diamondoids to create a honeycomb-like latticework, capable of finally containing the incredible pressure of the sub-atomic particles of which constitute this neutron-degenerate matter (caused because no two such particles can exist in the same place at the same time), and thus preventing their premature decay. By finally (and safely) bending neutronium to our will, they believe we can build fission-based spacecraft drives of once-unimaginable power.

TITechTemplate.description.NextGenerationAerospace=For too long, our efforts to venture beyond Earth have been inherently wasteful affairs. Every rocket jettisons multiple stages, each of which contains its own engines, propellant, and other equipment, during its passage into space. This is obscenely expensive, and also a source of increasingly problematic orbital debris fields. If we are to launch more spacecraft, more often, using them as we use airplanes, we must develop reusable vessels. While partially reusable vessels have flown in the past, new refinements in parachutes and airbags now allow the recovery of every stage. Because even this remains highly inefficient, our engineers have prototyped a far superior alternative - a single-stage-to-orbit, or SSTO, craft, which expend no major hardware during their flight. This has been achieved partly by advances in materials and construction techniques, which enable the craft to survive hypersonic flight and multiple orbital re-entries, and partly by improving mass-ratio sufficiently to carry both copious amounts of propellant and a crew/cargo payload all the way to orbit, without any need to separate. With this achieved, we can begin to think about reaching space as an almost everyday pursuit.

TITechTemplate.displayName.NuclearFissioninSpace=Nuclear Fission In Space
TITechTemplate.summary.NuclearFissioninSpace=We try out decades-old proposals for fission reactors and propulsion systems for space.
TITechTemplate.quote.NuclearFissioninSpace="In 1954, the Americans built the first nuclear-powered submarine, and changed the course of naval warfare.

It is upon us to define warfare in space."<br/><align=right>{resistLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>From a speech made while opening the Churchill Shipyards<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.NuclearFissioninSpace=Since we discovered nuclear fission in 1938, we have used this knowledge both to give and to take - to build power plants and weapons of mass destruction alike. With every passing decade, our understanding of the forces that rule the universe grew, and we were able to refine this process further. However, until now reactors needed the pull of gravity in order to contain the chain reaction, and to keep the water flowing. Without that flow, nothing happens - for fission heats water, water becomes steam, steam turns turbines, and turbines generate energy. <br/><br/>Now, combining our new concepts for deep space propulsion with our decades of experience in nuclear fission, we are able to stabilize the first nuclear reaction in space. With our new reactor designs, we no longer need gravity to collect the energy released by splitting atoms. Our new containment systems ensure a safe, sustained chain reaction in zero-g. <br/><br/>Thanks to this achievement, our fission-powered spacecraft can now reach the darkest and furthest corners of our solar system. Nuclear reactors will power ships, weapons, and habitats, enabling us to harness countless resources far beyond our homeworld's atmosphere and meet the aliens in the vast openness of space, rather than bound to our own soil. Furthermore, these new technologies will help us to build the next generation of solid fission systems and explore the even greater energy potential of nuclear fusion in space.

We must choose wisely every time, or we may never choose again."<br/><align=right>{appeaseLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Speech at the U.N. Science Summit<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.NuclearFusioninSpace=Ever since we gazed upon the burning sun in our sky, we have wondered how its light and power are created. As early as 1920, scientists theorized about the sheer endless possibilities of nuclear fusion. Now, with the countless challenges and opportunities presented by the arrival of life from outer space, it is imperative that we realize this dream of unprecedented energy.<br/><br/>We have finally made the impossible possible: controlled nuclear fusion in space. By using powerful superconducting magnets and lasers, we have refined the technology to push smaller atoms together so that they fuse into heavier elements. The trick to nuclear fusion is to overcome the repelling force that prevents atoms from fusing on their own. This allows the binding nuclear force to take over and merge the atoms together. When fusing lighter atoms into heavier ones, we observe Einstein's famous law making itself once more inarguable: energy and mass merge together to create something new, while releasing excess energy. It is this burst of released energy that is key to meeting the steep power requirements of deep-space habitats, but also of our ever more demanding spaceship drives and weapons.<br/><br/>Our scientists believe this breakthrough will help to level the playing field in the vast reaches of space. Now that the fundamentals of off-world fusion reactors have been proven possible, they predict that we shall soon see reactors running on lithium, hydrogen or even on two potent hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium. The versatility of this energy source will surely know no bounds.

TITechTemplate.description.OrbitalShipbuilding=The old rules of aerospace cease to be when there is less "aero" and more "space." Craft built for the purpose of traveling, transporting, and fighting in space have greater allowance for design versatility when friction and drag are no longer an issue; materials can be more dense and designs can be more utilitarian. This does mean, however, that ships built for space must be built in space, at least if we are to avoid time-consuming and costly haulage from Earth, not to mention finding room for the colossal factories. Once the sizable initial investment is complete, orbital shipyards will provide an essential anchorage from which commerce, construction, and combat vessels alike will be born.

TITechTemplate.description.OrbitalRingHabs=With the rudiments of long-term space existence now established, it is time to raise the stakes. More personnel, more improvements to their quality of life, and far more reliability and autonomy - further reducing the need for shipments from Earth. Even if we settle on other worlds, permanent waypoints in the space between them are a necessity if we are to efficiently transport craft, resources, and people between those worlds, and to oversee the many trade routes that spawn from such expansion. It is size that we must now address. Each resident requires a minimum volume of 17 cubic meters of personal space if they are to remain sane for more than a few months, but for orbital existence to become a long-term, large-scale prospect, we must now significantly exceed this baseline. Larger habs and more personnel also mean more of everything else, of course, more oxygen, more food, more medical supplies. Clustered and expandable micro-gravity modules, linked by arterial floataways, have been deemed the most practical approach for now, but once we move from scores of trained personnel to thousands of civilians, we will need not only larger habitats, but also a means of generating gravity.

TITechTemplate.description.OrbitalTorusHabs=Now that we can not only build colonies in space, but also have the technology and medicines to make long-term habitation relatively safe for those who live within them, the time has come to consider humanity's space future on a far grander scale. We now have designs for habitats that can support not just hundreds, but thousands of souls; entire societies who will never know what it is to feel real land beneath their feet. These will consist of not only of military and scientific personnel, but also families, children - new generations who will lead humanity even further into the stars. As such, comfort and quality of life - leisure, exercise, education - is paramount. To achieve that, we will need far more space and, to address the many health complications and inconveniences of zero-g, a semblance of gravity. The clustered, micro-gravity modules of yore cannot provide this, and so our engineers have devised a radically different design - the ring habitat. Nick-named 'donuts' for their bloated appearance, these rings both resemble and behave like vast wheels, their outer rims forever rotating upon great spokes - a process which creates gravity within those outer rims. The spokes themselves, and the hub they join to, remain in zero-gravity, and thus house the likes of spaceports, reactors, and storage. Life on board a Torus is not life on Earth, but it does at least approximate it - and, crucially, these vast cosmic donuts will enable us to truly found a human civilization in space.

TITechTemplate.description.OurSpaceFuture=There can be no going backwards now; humanity has both a military and an industrial presence in space, not to mention ever-growing numbers of personnel for whom a life on Earth is an increasingly distant memory. It is time to double-down on this, to no longer think of ourselves as an Earth-bound species. This means establishing new forms of law, order, and communication to govern land, airspace, and space alike, which will create untold turbulence as our new, hybrid society grows accustomed to it. In turn, this requires specially-trained forces, to defend against threats both internal and external. We now have concrete proposals on how to achieve this - and, once it is realized, we can think in earnest about founding true, and increasingly sizable, off-Earth societies.

A far cry from our earliest ventures, which were exclusively designed for scientific research, this new breed of space station is built for versatility - to provide off-world homes for dozens of souls, and from more walks of life than astronaut and engineer. Aside from essential life support and power functionality, the outposts are designed with a space future in mind. Each outpost, already a marvel in its own right, is capable of being further customized, depending on each one's specific mission requirements.

TITechTemplate.description.ParticleCannon=A particle cannon might sound like a concept ripped from the silver screen, yet until very recently the same was true for alien life. For the scientific community, our first prototype particle cannon has been a concept long in the making.<br/><br/>This new type of weapon fires highly focused, extremely short bursts of protons that can penetrate through various materials. These proton bundles are generated and accelerated using superconducting particle accelerators, while electromagnetic lenses focus and aim their beams.<br/><br/>Even though the tunable particle cannon can bypass most traditional armor, its range is currently very limited, due to the nature of charged particles. The particles repel each other so that, as soon as the beam leaves the confining electromagnetic fields of the accelerator, the bundle starts spreading, losing its deadly power. Nevertheless, for close combat, even in space, this first generation of particle cannon has the potential to be truly devastating.

The AI for these mirror systems has been trained on millions of hours of ship combat data, which enables it to predict enemy ship maneuvers based on even the smallest adjustment of course. These predictions, together with an ultrafast response time of mere nanoseconds, allow the AI to perform high-precision shots at moving targets, even at extreme distances.<br/><br/>This is the zenith of laser weapons - little, if anything, will be able to stand against it.

TITechTemplate.description.PhotonicComputing=Our current computing devices depend upon passing a current through increasingly tiny microchips, but the laws of physics present barriers we cannot circumvent. The road to the future is not paved in processors shrunk by a handful more nanometers, but instead in light - using photons - rather than electrons. By replacing electronic data transfer and storage with photonic, or optical, equivalents, we can dramatically increase both the speed and efficiency of our computational capabilities. Though optoelectronic hybrids exist, these systems lose nearly 30% of their energy, due to the inefficiency of signal conversion. Wholly optical circuits remove this inefficiency, and thus can process algorithms at a speed beyond the reach of traditional devices, while consuming far less energy. At last, we have our first working photonic chip. This is the breakthrough we have long needed - one that will ultimately birth an even brighter future of quantum computing and true artificial intelligence.

TITechTemplate.description.PlasmaWeapons=Now that we can use magnetic fields to both safely contain superheated gases and propel rounds from fearsomely powerful kinetic weapons, the logical next step is to weaponize plasma. Plasma rounds can burn through the even the heaviest armor - not to mention heat it up to such an extent that anything within will roast - but because the revised electromagnetic weapons our engineers have devised never come into physical contact with their hotter-than-the-sun projectiles, there is no risk of damage at the user-end. The trouble is that, once a plasma round is released from its weapon, it will almost immediately expand to a diameter of some five thousands kilometers - i.e. dissipating so rapidly as to be effectively useless unless fired at point-blank range. Physical jackets strong enough to contain the rounds are obviously an impossibility, but, by building upon previous electromagnetic breakthroughs, a temporary, self-sustaining magnetic field powerful enough to contain plasma's internal pressure until kinetic impact is now plausible. In other words, we can now build weapons almost nothing could hope to stand against.

Stemming from its foundations in the Human Genome Project, the latest advancements in predictive genetics will, in time, allow medical personnel to identify and correct for markers associated with complex diseases ranging from Type 2 Diabetes to the most obscure genetic disorders - and even most cancers. When combined with innovative analytics and cutting-edge AI, humans can expect to live longer, healthier lives.

TITechTemplate.description.ProtonBoronFusion=Successive generations of fusion technologies have lifted us far above the gravity well of our home planet, and enabled us to reach - and exploit - neighboring worlds. Thanks to deuterium-helium-3 fusion, the gulf between us and <i>them</i> has grown ever-smaller. However, deuterium is ultimately too scarce a fuel source to indefinitely sustain our expansion into space.<br/><br/>By building upon our understanding of deuterium-helium-3 fusion, our researchers have made a significant breakthrough - sustainable aneutronic fusion reaction, with strikingly low fuel costs. Proton-boron fusion is the key. Even despite their higher ignition temperature, both protons and boron are far more abundant in the solar system than deuterium. Our latest solid energy collectors can in addition harness this reaction efficiently, as they lose no energy to neutron radiation - all energy is instead released as electromagnetic radiation.<br/><br/>This new breed of fusion reactor will create more power at lower costs, and with less shielding required, thus paving the way to larger habitats and stations, and sleeker ships with more powerful drives. Yet, this is just the beginning of our quest to harness the power of the stars themselves.

TITechTemplate.description.ProtonProtonFusion=Since the beginning of the modern age, we have reached for the stars above. And since the revelation that there is indeed life on other worlds, we have sought their knowledge for ourselves. To achieve this, we will also need to claim the power of the sun for ourselves - to be specific, recreating the fusion chain that occurs within the heart of a star. Since the day we first accomplished nuclear fusion in space, we have created ever-stronger electromagnetic containment fields, we have designed multilayered reactor chambers, and we have developed ever more potent fuel sources.<br/><br/>By combining all these advances, we have at last mastered the most energetic fusion reaction in the universe: proton-proton fusion. Using a complex, yet elegant, web of electromagnetic fields, we press the protons together in our reactors, mimicking the extreme pressures and temperature of a sun, and fuse the protons into helium atoms. This reaction releases its massive energy as pure electromagnetic radiation and electrons. Both of these can be harvested by solid-state collectors, then transformed directly into energy. This thus enables the construction of breathtakingly efficient fusion reactors, and will allow humankind to spread its wings like never before.

TITechTemplate.description.QuantumComputing=A regular computer stores information as a series of zeroes and ones. No matter the data - be it a spreadsheet, an image, a video, a game - it all boils down to ones and zeroes. In that respect, even our most advanced devices are simply an evolution of the humble pocket calculator, despite being made up of transistors almost as small as an atom. Quantum computing is a profound change from this age-old approach, in that it can store information as both a zero and one at the same time. While this is a headache-inducing concept on paper, in practice what it means is that a quantum computer can perform multiple operations simultaneously, whereas even our best supercomputers process calculations one by one. In a single operation, a quantum computer can compute what would require a million million million million million calculations on a regular computer. This means breathtakingly complex results measured in milliseconds, shattering the hard barriers imposed by traditional and even photonic computing. Now that our hardware and software engineers have finally lifted quantum computers out of the realm of mere theory and into mass production-ready reality, we will soon be able to build devices able to deal with the near-infinite variables inherent to running off-world colonies and planetary-wide defense systems, generating true artificial intelligence and even deciphering the aliens' own advanced technology.

TITechTemplate.description.QuantumEncryption=Given that we will need to transmit highly-sensitive and hugely complex information through space potentially monitored by any number of forces unknown, making our data truly secure is an absolute imperative. We need truly unbreakable encryption, to ensure any communication cannot ever be read by anyone other than its intended recipient. It is our recent breakthrough in quantum computing that makes this possible - but it is this very same breakthrough that has made the need greater than ever before. With its ability to perform potentially billions of calculations simultaneously, a quantum computer could crack even our most complex encryption systems in a heartbeat. New, quantum-generated encryption methods are thus required, to ensure covert operations remain covert and to ensure our colonies and spacefaring vessels are safe from calamitous interference. Quantum key distribution has now been identified as the best path forwards, taking advantage as it does of the highly unpredictable behavior of subatomic particles to generate encryption keys without further slowing long-distance transmissions. For whoever can most successfully implement this, a truly unhackable future awaits.

TITechTemplate.description.Railguns=The future of weaponry is one without gunpowder, where electricity alone powers each killing shot. Railguns employ the foundational technology behind mass drivers to propel their projectiles at staggering speeds - with kinetic force to match. Our previous breakthroughs in electromagnetics have been refined to allow a remarkable degree of miniaturization. By flowing current through an elongated, magnetically-permeable rifle barrel (the sides of which are the titular "rails"), we can accelerate projectiles without the need for any explosive - achieving muzzle velocities far beyond even our most powerful explosive-based firearms.<br/><br/>This is of great benefit to both impact and range. In consequence, slugs fired from these new railguns are able to pierce the densest of armor at extreme distances. The degree of energy involved does raise significant issues with regard to heat and recoil (railguns kick like the proverbial mule), but the more severe limitation is durability, due to the sustained physical contact required between high-velocity rounds and the rifle's charged barrel.<br/><br/>Our researchers are, however, confident that subsequent discoveries in this field will bring about far more durable, and in turn far more powerful, electromagnetic weaponry. In the meantime, there is surely little that can stand against a railgun for long.

Beyond the initial programming, the requirement for human intervention or oversight is already dramatically reduced, but ultimately we hope to achieve total automation - not just of highly-specialized tasks, but potentially of almost every aspect of our society.

TITechTemplate.summary.SettlementHabs=Second-generation surface bases capable of hosting hundreds of personnel.
TITechTemplate.quote.SettlementHabs="Home is wherever you lay your head, it is said. If only this were true. Home, as far too many of us know, is only where no one is trying to destroy all that you hold dear."<br/><align=right>{appeaseLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Comments made during a BBC World Service interview, during civil wars in the Balkans<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.SettlementHabs=Our Outpost Habs have been a successful proof of concept; this means the time has now come to begin housing humans on other worlds in unprecedented numbers. This is not merely a question of construction, but most of all one of safety; even the slightest error, oversight or malfunction could cost hundreds, even thousands of lives. If we are to proceed from mere research outposts and towards something resembling a society, we need to think in the longer term. Oxygen-generation is paramount, as are sustainable food and fuel sources - but privacy, leisure, and education will also become ever-more pressing concerns. Thus, we must build habitats at scale, designed to be modular and expandable. While this remains early days for the spread of humanity beyond Earth's orbit, these nascent settlements can prepare other planets for eventual full colonization.

TITechTemplate.summary.Skywatch=The consolidation and advancement of aerospace surveillance systems.
TITechTemplate.quote.Skywatch="The trick is not to look directly at what you're trying to see. Offset your focal point somewhere to the side of where you think you noticed the movement.

TITechTemplate.description.Skywatch=The span of time humanity has spent in space is dwarfed by the span of time humanity has been interested in it. Earliest records of the telescope date to the turn of the 17th century, with regular advancement made every century thereafter. It therefore follows that, on the shoulders of programs such as SETI, we consolidate our resources into a unified observation and surveillance program so we can maintain active, constant surveillance on the nearer parts of the Solar System.

TITechTemplate.displayName.SolidCoreFissionSystems=Solid Core Fission Systems
TITechTemplate.summary.SolidCoreFissionSystems=These fission reactors use solid fuels made of heavy radioactive elements to generate energy.
TITechTemplate.quote.SolidCoreFissionSystems="We will never know if Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn even dreamed that their discovery of nuclear fission would one day be used to build spaceships. Let us hope, nevertheless, that we would have made them proud."<br/><align=right>{cooperateLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Keynote Speech at Spaceport Summit<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.SolidCoreFissionSystems=When nuclear fission was discovered in 1938, few would have believed that we would one day use it to launch mankind into the vast endlessness of space. And yet, based on our foundational work in achieving nuclear fission in space, we now have created the first generation of solid core fission systems to power both habitats and spaceships.<br/><br/>By using solid fuel made of heavy, radioactive materials, such as uranium dioxide or plutonium oxide, we can create a reactor that sustains the chain reaction even in zero-g. The first fission reaction is activated by bombarding the solid fuel with slow-moving neutrons to overcome the binding nuclear force that holds the nucleus of an atom together, releasing a flood of neutrons and energy as it breaks apart. This released energy is captured as heat by pressured water cooling systems designed for space.<br/><br/>This is an advancement that will enable new and larger habitats beyond Earth's orbit, and spaceship drives more powerful than ever before possible. Future fission systems will likely employ molten or gas core fuels, which our researchers believe will put us on a more even footing with the alien visitors. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.SpaceAgriculture=Space Agriculture
TITechTemplate.summary.SpaceAgriculture=The implementation of farming techniques in a micro and null gravity environment.
TITechTemplate.quote.SpaceAgriculture="My family had this farm in Mississippi. You name it, they grew it - corn, soybeans, cotton ... There was so much to do, day and night. It wasn't the life I wanted, but it did teach me that you have to work hard if you want to nurture a living thing into the very best version of itself."<br/><align=right>{submitLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Interview from the podcast <i>Eighth Chakra</i><align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.SpaceAgriculture=It is inconvenient, cumbersome, and risky to send copious amounts of food on every manned flight, while for our stations to remain dependent on supply drops from Earth is short-term thinking in the extreme. It is paramount that space-based personnel can grow their own food, even in environments with little-to-no gravity and a hostile atmosphere. Closed Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) are our best hope here; in other words, a sealed loop, which creates both food and oxygen, while requiring only light, power, and human personnel. The carbon dioxide exhaled by the latter is transformed into oxygen by plants, while their urine and waste-water is recycled into drinking water, and their excrement and food waste is used to grow the nutrient-rich plants. Such systems have been pursued without success for decades, but the creation of a new strain of fast-growing, protein-rich algae has finally yielded the breakthrough we need. In time, we will be able to vary our astronauts' diets by introducing leafy plants and even fish farms, which will make long-term off-planet habitation that much more comfortable.

TITechTemplate.description.SpaceAssaultDoctrine=It is neither cheap nor easy to construct facilities in space, or on other worlds. As such, we would be foolish to simply raze any pre-existing structure we might encounter during a military operation. Building upon all our former strategies and technologies concerning non-terrestrial infantry, we are now able to stage larger and better-trained fighting forces, able to seize as well as destroy sizable enemy assets. This in itself will require new facilities, new equipment, and new forms of training, but the net result will be that we will have soldiers as adept in space as we do on land. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.SpaceCommerce=Space Commerce
TITechTemplate.summary.SpaceCommerce=We allow private enterprises to explore mining, construction, trade, and settlement interests in space.

TITechTemplate.description.SpaceCommerce=Inevitably, private businesses have taken a keen interest in humanity's expansion into space. Mining rights are particularly in demand, while other firms bid to build factories, and even commercial habitats. Careful regulation and the assignment of contracts and trade routes are thus necessary to achieve something never before attempted - transport goods and resources, in bulk, between Earth and space, and from station to station. This nascent commercialization of the solar system is, of course, but a stepping stone towards a true, shared economy between Earth and space, allowing private enterprises to claim their stake can only accelerate the process.

TITechTemplate.displayName.SpaceMedicine=Space Medicine
TITechTemplate.summary.SpaceMedicine=Doctors design short-term treatment and long-term therapies for space environments.
TITechTemplate.quote.SpaceMedicine="What we're doing is dangerous - people <i>are</i> going to get sick or hurt. It would be madness to pretend otherwise.

TITechTemplate.description.SpaceMedicine=Space is hell on the human body. Micro-gravity stresses our bodies to a near-breaking point, and that is even before taking into account the sheer complexity of treating unexpected illness or injury within a cramped and closed environment with finite resources. When the human body no longer has to fight against Earth's gravity, it will suffer reduced muscle mass, strength, and aerobic capacity. Exercise can mitigate this, but cannot address the weakening of our bones - and the risk of even a slight impact causing terrible breakage. Fortunately, we have now made great strides in addressing the bone density issue. Where previously calcium supplements to re-strengthen bones carried too high a risk of causing kidney stones, a breakthrough in slow-release, subcutaneous capsules has been proven to keep bones sturdy even over months-long flights, and without side effects. The efficacy over years or even decades is another matter, but in combination with targeted, strength-building exercise regimes and future refinements to the treatment, we are confident of solving both this and other such problems. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.SpaceMiningandRefining=Space Mining and Refining
TITechTemplate.summary.SpaceMiningandRefining=We develop methods to extract and refine space resources in airless and low-gravity environments.

One might as well build a house upon a pile of rice."<br/><align=right>{escapeLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>From his irregular newsletter, "Preparing For Tomorrow."<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.SpaceMiningandRefining=Hauling raw materials up Earth's gravity well is the very opposite of a long-term plan. In order to spread further into space, we must be able to obtain at least some of what we need from space. Fortunately, nearby asteroids have no shortage of minerals and rare metals, from which we can begin to construct ships and facilities in space. Iron, carbon, aluminum, copper, oxygen, nitrogen, and water will be most urgently required, but gold and platinum will be readily available too. But one cannot mine in space as one would on Earth. For one thing, low or micro-gravity mean mined resources cannot tumble neatly into containers or be automatically gravity-separated by type, while structures cannot be directly built upon the surface.<br/><br/>And so it is that the first method devised to address this is a distinctly unglamorous one - a system of long (up to 1 kilometer) cables and collection bags to tether equipment to an asteroid, and to prevent mined resources from simply floating away. This is an important start, but truly mass-mining will require far more advanced solutions - and the capability to do and use more in situ form, rather than depend on what Earth can send.

TITechTemplate.description.SpaceResearch=Dating back to early space research efforts on board the International Space Station in the late 20th century, advances in biology, physics, and chemistry have expanded the human understanding of concepts otherwise impossible to explore under normal terrestrial conditions. As space travel - and longer-term space habitation - becomes more commonplace, we can study and ultimately respond to the myriad effects of micro-gravity on the human body, improve methods of growing food and generating oxygen, and even experiment with new power sources. Initially, this will involve the expansion of our orbital space stations, but as further breakthroughs are made, we will be able to move ever-further away from Earth's embrace.

TITechTemplate.description.SpaceTourism=Hot on the heels of any pioneers are the entrepreneurs, hungrily chasing a new frontier filled with danger, wonder, and opportunity in equal measure. As we refine our methods of space travel and habitation to become faster, safer, and most of all cheaper, there will undoubtedly be a cadre of those keen to turn the black into gold. From honeymooners to retirees, whether a spring break or a corporate retreat, now is the prudent time to invest in and regulate for an infrastructure that will allow humanity at large - and not just the super-rich - to experience the world beyond their sky. The vast profits to be reaped from the resultant slew of consumer transports, sightseeing tours, and orbital hotels can then be funneled into our other expansion efforts, as well as serving as something of a dry run for long-term human existence in space. 

TITechTemplate.displayName.Supercapacitors=Supercapacitors
TITechTemplate.summary.Supercapacitors=To power the weapons of tomorrow, we combine the power storage of a battery with the rapid charging and release of a capacitor.
TITechTemplate.quote.Supercapacitors="It's not about who has the biggest gun. Sometimes it's not even about who's got the most guns. Often, it simply comes to down to who can reload fastest."<br/><align=right>{destroyLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>Quoted in his official biography "Five Moves Ahead" (cancelled before publication)<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.Supercapacitors=Unlike a chemical battery, an electrostatic capacitor charges almost instantly and does not readily wear out, but can only contain a minute quantity of energy. As our power needs snowball, we require a best-of-both-worlds solution: the capacity of a battery and the charging speed of a capacitor. The primary obstacle until now has been one of mass. A capacitor with storage to rival that of our largest batteries would require prohibitively enormous and heavy metal plates.<br/><br/>It is our recent discoveries in the field of carbon manipulation that can resolve this. We can both reduce the width of the insulating barrier between the two conducting plates at a molecular level, therefore, reducing the supercapacitor's overall size, and we can coat the plates in new, porous nanomaterials that effectively increase the surface area without increasing the plate size. In short, rather than swell our capacitors to unworkable sizes, we instead increase their effectiveness at the atomic level. Several of these arranged in series will replicate the capacity of a battery, while retaining their lighting-fast storage and release of energy, which in turn will feed the vast power requirements of our next-generation weapons.

TITechTemplate.displayName.SuperconductingMagnets=Superconducting Magnets

Foolish, really, for one day they will become the very bedrock of our society."<br/><align=right>{cooperateLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>In an interview with Wired magazine, 2016<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.SuperconductingMagnets=Electromagnetics have become the cornerstone of our technological progress, but as it becomes necessary to contain and direct ever-greater forces, we in turn must generate far stronger magnetic fields. Our newly-designed superconducting magnets operate very similarly to existing electromagnets, but have effectively zero resistance to electricity. No resistance means no heat generation and no energy loss. This efficiency means much more power, which, in practical terms, means magnetic fields should allow us to contain hydrogen without adding extra mass to our ship systems. The effect may even be strong enough to keep antimatter separate from matter. This is an important breakthrough in terms of meeting both our future power and weapon needs. The roadblock until now has been the requirement to keep such coils as low as -452 degrees Fahrenheit, but the creation of low-footprint, affordable cryo-coolers finally makes this plausible even when space and weight is at a premium.

TITechTemplate.description.TargetedBiologicalWarfare=Even the most advanced weapon at our disposal is, in practice, nothing more than a blunt instrument. One designed only to destroy anything it might impact. This is both wasteful and hazardous, squandering potentially valuable resources while littering space - and even our own atmosphere - with potentially radioactive debris. There is a better way, which is to target our foes on a genetic level. Military scientists have now successfully weaponized prior work in phages to assault their very DNA. Effectively, by using nanoscopic biological machines, we can kill a foe carrying specific genetic markers without firing a shot - and, ideally, before they themselves can fire a shot. This would also enable us to neutralize unwanted presences without risking harm to our own people or structures.

TITechTemplate.description.TerawattFusionReactors=By building upon multiple discoveries - the ability to bring about nuclear fusion in space, the creation of nanomaterials able to safely contain this force, and implants that enable humans to oversee the almost unfathomable amounts of energy that result from it - we are ready for a significant step-change in reactor technology. As well as providing even more power to our growing facilities and larger craft, these newest fusion reactors could potentially even generate enough terawatts to power laser-based launch methods. Humanity's power needs will only grow as we expand and evolve further, and with these reactors we are eminently well-placed to meet them.

TITechTemplate.description.TitanicSpacecraft=The Sol system is humanity's to explore and lay claim to, but truly doing so will require more personnel, and perhaps more might, than ever before. It perhaps might sound crude, but the best solution is the most obvious one: larger ships, able to carry more crew, more supplies, more weapons, and denser armor. What was once an engineering absurdity - for to cast so titanic a craft between worlds would have taken decades at best - is now entirely possible, thanks to our incredibly powerful reactor and propulsion technologies. Mass is, as ever, the foremost obstacle, compounded by the need to carry sufficient fuel and propellant to maintain a high Delta-v for weeks at a time. And, for any potential attempt to leave this system for another, even years. So it is that we now have workable designs for enormous craft built around the "torchship" principle, possessing both high thrust and high specific impulse, in a state of near-constant acceleration, and so nakedly powerful that the mass of their vast hulls is barely a factor.

TITechTemplate.description.TransformPhages=With the majority of diseases and genetic disorders now preventable and even correctable thanks to recent developments in predictive genetics, our intentions now turn towards something more ambitious - biologically repairing a human body. Bacteriophages have long been used to treat bacterial infections, but it is how they achieve this that makes them so valuable: they inject DNA directly into a bacterial cell, thus rewriting its genetic identity. But what if we could further 'program' synthetic phages to carry other types of DNA, and to target specific human cells? We need wonder no longer. For now, the focus is on correcting genetic-level problems on the fly, in a live subject - baby steps towards altering the very information that makes us, us. The ultimate potential of phage-based gene-editing ranges from simple transformations in appearance to the building of more and stronger muscle material, more durable organs, and even the ability to adapt alien genetic material into our own bodies. Eventually, we shall make the human body not simply more long-lasting, but better in every conceivable way.

TITechTemplate.description.TransInterfaceWarfare=Over the past few decades, we have refined our combat laser technology by boosting their power, creating ultra-precise mirrors, and designing hyper-efficient wavelength shifters. Now, we have combined these advancements into powerful, fixed weapon emplacements, designed for the defense of human settlements.<br/><br/>By combining an array of powerful lasers with cutting-edge sensors, these turrets are capable of targeting and destroying incoming missiles and ships before they reach the ground. They are even capable of firing their beams at targets in low orbit.<br/><br/>The technological breakthrough that made these systems possible is the highly advanced, nanoparticle-coated mirror system, which ensures high-precision targeting together with ultra-fast reaction times, granting nearly full coverage of the skies above. Think of these emplacements as a vast shield, taking the form of a boundlessly destructive weapon.

TITechTemplate.description.Ultracapacitors=Following the successful development of supercapacitors, the next step is perhaps inevitable - for electrostatic capacitors to entirely replace traditional, chemical batteries as our primary means of energy storage and delivery. It is to graphene we now turn for the nanomaterials from which to construct next-generation ultracapacitors. Often called a "wonder material," this carbon allotrope is the most durable substance known to man; and also only a single atom thick, which means we can apply a vast amount of it as nanopores upon a conductive plate without meaningfully increasing the capacitor's dimensions. Graphene's remarkable electrical properties are also far beyond that of carbon nanotubes. Ultracapacitors based around graphene electrodes would, therefore, be far more efficient as well as more lightweight - and thus are exactly what is required to store and release huge amounts of fusion energy, and to charge to our most powerful lasers.

TITechTemplate.description.UltravioletCombatLasers=While the move to laser weapons utilizing visible light has increased their power and versatility, their shortcomings in range hamper their usefulness in long-distance conflicts. It is to ultraviolet-based combat lasers we now turn instead. Extreme ultraviolet is breathtakingly difficult to work with, because it burns through almost all matter on contact - ideal for striking against heavily-armored enemies, yes, but first we need to focus it without instantly destroying the necessary lenses and mirrors in the process.<br/><br/>Special new dielectric mirrors, coated with multiple layers of ultra-dense, highly reflective nanomaterials, overcome this complication, enabling our latest weapons to utilize the ultraviolet spectrum without losing intensity. These laser systems are capable of shooting precise beams over long distances, to inflict massive damage. By using ultraviolet light, we have also further reduced the scattering effect of atmospheric particles, making these latest weapons even more powerful in Earth's atmosphere as well as within the vacuum of space.

TITechTemplate.description.UnityMovements=Historically, people are defined by national and geographical borders.

By beginning the long process of organizing like-minded states into new alliances, and even collectives, the peoples of the world will be better able to endure the seismic changes caused by both the alien arrival and humanity's rapid technological evolution. This will require a new approach to democracy, and, in some cases, the overthrow of unsympathetic local leaders. The disruption will be unthinkable, but there is potential for even greater world unity in its wake.

TITechTemplate.description.VacuumElectrostaticPrinciples=Electrostatic propulsion, in which an electrical field is applied to the ions within a propellant in the desired direction of acceleration, is nothing new - already, we have probes, which ionize xenon gas in order to create limited thrust. This is possible only in the vacuum of space, for such propulsion methods could overcome neither air resistance nor gravitational pull.<br/><br/>However, even though the propellant is ejected some twenty times faster than from a classical chemical thruster, the sheer electrical power required to sustain it currently makes it infeasible for larger craft, let alone to achieve take-off or landing. As new technologies enable greater levels of on-board electrical power, electric propulsion can become more of a reality, however. The likes of Gridded Ion Drives, Hall Effect Thrusters, and High Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thrusters offer great potential for longer, further-reaching missions. Thanks to successful experiments with an array of rare gases and liquid metals as propellants, our researchers have been able to create moderate electrostatic thrust that is sustained for far longer than any known chemical method, and uses far less propellant. By building upon these principles, they believe we can not only create faster craft, but potentially also devastating energy weapons and even devise methods of containing unstable, deadly plasma.

TITechTemplate.description.VisibleCombatLasers=While laser weapon systems for spacecraft have rewritten the rules of space combat, the power of our initial, infrared lasers is only effective over a relatively short range. To overcome this shortcoming, our researchers have worked tirelessly on designing combat lasers that instead utilize visible light beams.<br/><br/>By switching from infrared to visible light, our laser weapons not only benefit from a greater range, but may also be used within Earth's skies. Visible light scatters far less than infrared light in our atmosphere, thus enabling the laser pulse to retain most of its strength. To achieve the same power output in visible lasers as with infrared systems, our weapon engineers turn to lasers which employ chemical reactions to generate their pulses, as well as to new multi-layered dielectric mirrors, which reflect nearly 99.9999 percent of the incoming light beam. The result is the most powerful - and most versatile - laser weapon yet.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the best is yet to come - future concepts for energy weapons include powerful defensive emplacements and combat laser arrays.

Now more than ever, we must come together as a people, and prove to the universe that although we may no longer be its centre as we once believed, we are no less important.

TITechTemplate.description.WhiteCollarAutomation=While AI and quantum computing have been able to manage many of the more everyday functions of society - manufacturing, maintenance, transportation, and the like - without the need for extensive human oversight, they have until now been too limited to be trusted with higher functions. But as humanity spreads further and wider throughout our solar system, and the systems, which govern and safeguard us, grow ever more complicated, it becomes necessary to explore new, more efficient ways of handling tasks that previously required a high level of knowledge, such as finance, law, IT, customer support, human resources, and even medical diagnosis. Further advancements in AI - many of which originate from the AI's own, self-repairing software - now make this possible, removing the earlier risks of failure and even disaster. After extensive testing, we have determined that a new generation of bots can be safely entrusted with a vast number of administrative tasks. Accepting such a degree of automation will involve no small amount of societal change, but we are now primed to move to a truly digital workforce, where humans, AI, and machines work in harmony to meet the many needs of our increasingly distributed race.

TITechTemplate.summary.ZPinchTechniques=Our spacecraft become capable of dramatically-increased thrust by using electricity alone to trigger a sustained fusion reaction.
TITechTemplate.quote.ZPinchTechniques="When I was a kid, the threat of nuclear armageddon was on every front page, every day. So forgive me if I get just a tiny bit anxious when you tell me that our best hope of sailing the stars is staging nuclear explosions inside our spacecraft."<br/><align=right>{resistLeader}<align=left><br/><align=right>In an email, receiving address encrypted<align=left>
TITechTemplate.description.ZPinchTechniques=Zeta-pinch, or z-pinch for short, involves passing an electrical current through plasma to generate an internal magnetic field, which pulls its particles towards each other - in effect, compressing the plasma. This is far from a new discovery, but the technique is of specific interest now because, if the plasma is made from fusion fuel, a sufficient degree of compression will trigger a self-sustaining thermonuclear fusion reaction. A spacecraft's magnetic nozzle can then safely convert this immense energy into far greater thrust than any chemical propulsion could possibly achieve. At least in theory: this technique has been impossible to achieve previously due to the wildly unstable nature of plasma, which moves so rapidly and so unpredictably that only a limited amount of it will undergo fusion, meaning the reaction cannot be sustained for long. So it is a recent breakthrough in plasma stabilization that makes Z-Pinch-based thrusters feasible at last. By applying principles of fluid dynamics - essentially, forcing the plasma flow in a given direction - our scientists have been able to stabilize a z-pinch for several thousand times longer. In addition, the z-pinch method removes the need for large and heavy coils to generate magnetic fields, thus reducing the craft's overall mass, which in turn also means travelling further and faster through space.
