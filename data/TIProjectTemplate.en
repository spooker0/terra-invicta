TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirSignatures=Alien Signatures
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirSignatures=We study the recovered samples to learn how to detect alien activity.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirSignatures=There is no doubt: extraterrestrial life has touched down on Earth. The many questions we have regarding its origin, its species, and its intent will have to wait. All that matters now is finding it. By cross-referencing reports of unusual events in the vicinity of the landing site with similar data from our global intelligence network, we have developed a tracking system able to reliably identify disappearances most likely resulting from alien activity.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirMethods=Alien Methods
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirMethods=We track signs of alien activity to attempt to determine why they are abducting humans.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirMethods=Having uncovered evidence of multiple livestock abductions some time before the first correlated human disappearance, it would seem that the aliens have been observing us long enough to understand Earth's biological and social hierarchies. In short, they have steadily worked their way up the food chain.<br/><br/>By analyzing patterns - the species, locations, the frequency, the subtlety or lack thereof, the proximity to settlements - of recent disappearances, we can now paint a clear picture of their methodology.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirOperations=Alien Operations
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirOperations=We study returned abductees to determine what exactly has happened to them.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirOperations=Unhelpfully, domestic law enforcement tends to close investigations once apparent abductees return, and thus it has fallen to our local operatives to follow-up the many rumors of erratic or aberrant behavior amongst the reappeared. Concerningly, their investigations and interviews strongly corroborate these reports, and indeed suggest that the true purpose of alien abductions is something other than mere research and experimentation.<br/><br/>We do have some new understandings on alien activities and how humans may resist them.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirMovements=Alien Movements
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirMovements=We now attempt to track alien movements to locate individual aliens on Earth.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirMovements=By studying residue found in the vicinity of reported alien sightings, we have established that, rather than sweating liquid as humans do, these aliens dissipate heat in a similar manner to dry ice sublimating from solid to gas.<br/><br/> Fortunately for us, tracking this is relatively straightforward. During the peak of the Global War on Terror, most nations were already using forward-looking infrared (FLIR) to detect biological aerosol threats. By expanding the quantities and capabilities of such systems, we will be able to detect the presence of this alien byproduct in real time.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirOrigin=Alien Origin
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirOrigin=We use astronomical data to theorize about where the aliens are coming from.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirOrigin=There are a multitude of theories about whether the aliens hail from, running the gamut from plausible to absurd. Maddeningly, our further study of alien debris cannot quite be said to rule anything out. Our long-range scanners have confirmed that, yes, there is a large and strikingly regular-shaped mass of similar materials in the deeper reaches of this solar system, strongly suggesting the presence of some manner of alien installation. However, our scans have also confirmed that not all of the substances within the debris are available locally, as it were. Thus, though our visitors do indeed have an industrial-scale presence within Sol's orbit, they almost certainly did not originate from it. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_HydraBiology=Hydra Biology
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_HydraBiology=We perform an autopsy on the Hydra corpus to deepen our understanding of alien physiology.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_HydraBiology=Our pre-autopsy assessment reveals that, as expected, the aliens are carbon-based and breathe oxygen, like ourselves. Their ability to exist without protection on Earth makes it highly likely that the atmospheric composition on their home world is highly similar to our own. More unexpected is that the prevailing "inverted knees" anatomical theory is incorrect. What we are seeing is not the knee, but the ankle - thus, their leg anatomy is akin that of a horse or dog. Since this type of structure is better suited to speed than climbing, it is highly likely these aliens evolved on flatter terrain, and perhaps were once prey for another species.<br/><br/>The autopsy itself has yielded invaluable detail on the aliens' physiology - specifically, how they are capable of feats and abilities impossible for any species on Earth.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_Pherocytes=Pherocytes
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_Pherocytes=We commission a study into the origin, mechanism, and effects of the alien process capable of overriding human self determination.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_Pherocytes=Where a pheromone is a chemical that can influence the recipient's behavior, our investigation of this so-called "pherocyte" reveals that it is an actual living cell. The distinction is that a pheromone's effect wears off relatively quickly, whereas pherocytes are capable of reproducing in the recipient's body, thereby extending the effect for significantly longer.<br/><br/>When cross-referencing fMRI scans with electroencephalographic data, we find that an awake subject's brain exhibits an abnormally high level of theta waves. These are normally only present during REM sleep or deep hypnosis - and, when as copious as seen in a pherocyte-affected subject, will make them unusually suggestible.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_AlienContainment=Alien Containment
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_AlienContainment=We develop a holding cell capable of preventing a captured alien from using its abilities to escape.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_AlienContainment=Our architects have devised an alien containment facility that is disarmingly simple but highly effective in its design. Essentially, two concentric circles are placed at the precise center of a larger triangle. The inner detainment chamber utilizes a multi-stage particulate absorbing filtration system to protect against pherocyte release, so that we may safely monitor the entity from the outer circle. Each corner of the triangle houses a heavily-armed guard post, the equal distance between ensuring each that, in the unlikely event that a captive escaped then slew or turned personnel within one of them, the other two can respond simultaneously. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_HydraLanguage=Hydra Language
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_HydraLanguage=Linguistics experts and machine learning work in tandem to decipher the rudiments of the alien language. 
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_HydraLanguage=While it will take some time to fully comprehend the Hydra language, we have now identified sufficient patterns and repeating elements to establish the core concepts behind it. Essentially, their method of communication is two-fold - an auditory aspect much like our own, and, perhaps more importantly, a pherocyte-based aspect, which chemically and wordlessly conveys the emotional context of their otherwise functional speech. We can now proceed with direct translation of the spoken element, should we wish it. It remains to be seen, however, how effective any attempt at communication will be without replication of the chemosensory element. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirTechnology=Alien Technology
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirTechnology=We examine recovered alien technology to reveal its strengths, weaknesses and potential applications.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirTechnology=Since the moment we recovered it, our research and engineering divisions have been constantly requesting samples of the alien technology. Today alone we have seen no less than 48 requests for everything from recovered databanks to simple bulkhead fasteners.<br/><br/>This is understandable, given that each item is a potential treasure trove of knowledge, both at a technological level - how does it operate, and what is its purpose? - and a chemical one - what was it created from, and where? The recovered technology has begun to yield its secrets, the theoretical applications of which very much depend on our own intentions. Unfortunately, with such a finite amount of these alien artifacts to hand, we can for now only scratch the surface of their potential.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_Exotics=Exotic Materials
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_Exotics=We further analyze samples of the recovered extrasolar material essential to the aliens' construction and war effort.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_Exotics=After exhaustive analyses and stress tests, we have little idea of what this material truly is. We do, however, know what it is not. Despite previously believing that these so-called “Exotics” were some manner of hitherto unknown alloy, we have determined that it can also exist in a non-solid state, such as within the coolant of the alien warship's heatsinks. It would appear that, rather than being a construction material itself, it will instead improve and augment the durability or electrical conductivity of any other substance it is applied to.<br/><br/>While establishing the exact composition of Exotics continues to elude us - most certainly, they are not of our solar system - we have been able to separate significant quantities of them from the alien materials they are bonded to. This has enabled us to attempt implementation of the material in many of our own technologies - and, happily, it readily adapts to almost any process it is subjected to, as its atomic structure can move between anionic to cationic with ease. It is, simply, astonishingly versatile.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_ExoticHybridSystems=Exotic Hybrid Systems
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_ExoticHybridSystems=We explore possible applications of the alien Exotics for extreme long-distance space travel.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_ExoticHybridSystems=Some among us might behold the remarkable properties of the alien Exotics and see only a potent source of weapons and armor. Yet it is in looking beyond the ancient human proclivity for conflict that we have unlocked the alien material's greatest potential. Initial experiments in instead applying it to prototype drives and reactors have resulted in feats of efficiency, conductivity and resilience far beyond what was previously thought possible. There is growing confidence that this discovery could even enable humanity to travel beyond our own solar system.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_ANewHome=A New Home
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_ANewHome=We scan neighboring solar systems for signs of a 'Goldilocks' planet capable of sustaining human life.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_ANewHome=Two things are required if we are to settle beyond the furthest reaches of the Sol system. The first is a craft capable of safely and rapidly taking us so great a distance. The second is knowing where we are going once we get there. This latter has now been addressed - theoretically, at least. Our most advanced deep-space viewing telescope, Aesir, has finally completed its extensive survey of solar systems within plausible range of our own, enabling us to identify several worlds that may be fit for human life. “May” being very much the operative term, however.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_HydraDiplomacy=Hydra Diplomacy
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_HydraDiplomacy=We reach out to our visitors in the hope of establishing sustained and mutually-beneficial communication.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_HydraDiplomacy=What was before a crude and faltering exchange of words between ourselves and the Hydra has now become an official line of two-way communication. Establishing this proved far from easy, in part due to the lack of a natural olfactory element in our own language, heightening the risk of misunderstanding - or worse, an aggressive response. Surprisingly, the greater obstacle in fact proved to be an apparent indifference on the aliens' part, no matter the content of our messages - as though they considered us beneath notice, despite their clear interest in Earth. Persistence has, however, proved to be a virtue, and careful finessing of our overtures towards the Hydra has finally prompted a response.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheAlienNation=The Alien Nation
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheAlienNation=We draw up plans for the creation of a new state, governed by the Emissaries - for the betterment of all humankind.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheAlienNation=There is only one path to ascension, and that is our willing submission to the Emissaries. This has proven to be a bitter pill for even some of our own to swallow, accustomed as we humans are to organizing and governing ourselves. Attaining a consensus that we must become a glorious new nation with one vision, one purpose, ruled over with all-seeing, all-knowing beneficence by the Emissaries, was the first and foremost obstacle to its founding. But it was also a vital lesson - while we have, fortunately, now achieved unity of purpose amongst ourselves, this is not a battle we can fight continually. Fortunately, we have now devised a permanent solution: a facility which will enable the Emissaries to control the very hearts and minds of those who doubt them.<br/><br/>We have been assured the Emissaries will share with us the fruits of its nation that they have no need for; its scientific and space programs will serve us directly.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_HydraInterrogation=Hydra Interrogation
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_HydraInterrogation=We write a new chapter in human history by dialoging with a sentient extraterrestrial species.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_HydraInterrogation=Since the Hydra language is an agglutinative tonal language based primarily around olfactory emissions, it has taken incredible time and patience to divine useful meaning from our captive's multisensory declarations. Every failure is an opportunity to learn, of course - each unfortunate dead end our questioning reached only granted greater insight into the alien's strange language. After countless such stumbles, a discourse of sorts has been established.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirPurpose=Their Purpose
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirPurpose=We probe our captive further to glean why the Hydras launched an invasion of our planet.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirPurpose=We have been able to solicit invaluable information from the alien captive, thanks to a discovery that Hydra falsehoods carry unique pherocyte signatures. Because it transpires that a Hydra will rather go silent than be caught lying (as far as we can tell, an unsuccessful deception is a source of great shame), it has been surprisingly straightforward to establish which matters the alien is relatively willing to discuss - with full confidence that it is not deceiving us. In consequence, we have now gleaned significant understanding of its species' intentions for Earth.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirDemands=Their Demands
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirDemands=We seek to ascertain what the Hydra expect from us in exchange for the cessation of all hostilities.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirDemands=Thanks to our efforts both in translation and in limited recreation of their pherocyte-based communication, the Hydra have, thankfully, shown some willingness to not only to engage with us, but also to simplify their complex “tongue” for our sake. Their latest, and clearest, response brings good news and bad. The good: they do not currently intend to simply destroy humanity outright. The bad: they stipulate a degree of subjugation far beyond our reasonable expectations.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirWeakness=Their Weakness
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirWeakness=In order to balance the scales, we investigate whether the aliens are susceptible to any particular form of attack.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirWeakness=While it is tempting to regard the Hydra as almost godlike compared to humanity, were that truly the case they would have simply seized Earth in one fell swoop. The question, then, is not of whether there is any chink in their armor, but of exactly where it is located. Of course, no species, least of all a sentient one, would ever willingly reveal its own vulnerabilities. As such, directly questioning the Hydra about what they most fear was inevitably a fool's errand. More indirect methods were instead required - and have yielded a singularly valuable insight.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_PherocyteResistance=Pherocyte Resistance
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_PherocyteResistance=We seek a means of blocking the aliens' mental control of human subjects. 
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_PherocyteResistance=Until we can ascertain some means of overcoming the aliens' chemosensory-based “mind-control”, we are ultimately doomed to be in their thrall. Needless to say, this is highly undesirable. But, armed with the knowledge that pherocytes are not a mere chemical signal, but in fact living cells, we have been able to formulate a treatment that shields humans from their effects.  A vaccine, as it were - albeit one which requires regular booster shots in order to remain effective. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_Wormholes=Wormholes
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_Wormholes=We search deep space for signs of the traversable wormhole used by the aliens to reach our solar system.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_Wormholes=The phenomena known as wormholes entail two points in spacetime, connected via an instantaneous quantum tunnel, most likely propped open by matter with negative mass. Though theorized about as early as 1916, they have never been proven to exist - until now.<br/><br/>Our deep-space scans indicate a localized gravitational anomaly beyond the orbit of Neptune, where there very much should not be one. Specifically, we are registering gravity flowing "inwards" from a point orbiting an otherwise nondescript celestial body in the Kuiper Belt. Our readings appear consistent with that of a stable Ellis Drainhole. In other words, we believe we are looking at the first recorded instance of a traversable wormhole. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheChokePoint=The Choke Point
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheChokePoint=We formulate plans to turn the tide by exploiting the alien supply line.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheChokePoint=Further study of the Hydra wormhole confirms that it closely follows the rules first set down by Homer G. Ellis in his 1969 “Drainhole” theory. Its design is essentially two circular planes connected at the center by two smaller circles of equal diameter - like two cymbals touching, or the central part of an hourglass. The Drainhole's nature means that gravity flows in a single direction, emptying any matter that passes through it into the other side. This means that travelling from the origin side requires far less energy than travelling from the opposite direction.<br/><br/>The simplest method of neutralizing the alien threat would thus appear to be closing or destroying the wormhole on our end, therefore isolating them from their reinforcements and source of Exotics. In practice, however, this approach will be far from straightforward.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_HydraBiowarfare=Hydra Biowarfare
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_HydraBiowarfare=We establish how to turn the Hydra's greatest weakness into humanity's greatest advantage.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_HydraBiowarfare=The revelation that, for all their arrogance, the Hydra have a deep-seated fear of biological assault has been a guiding light as we seek an easier way to slaughter them - and ultimately defeat them once and for all. Our studies have confirmed that, due to the invaders' very nature, a particular form of bioweapon is indeed their Achilles Heel. Our virologists have been able to exploit this weakness to devastating effect in small-scale testing, but doing so at the scale required to put an end to their inhuman threat will require greater innovation.
 
TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_PherocyteMastery=Pherocyte Mastery
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_PherocyteMastery=We seek a means of turning the tables on the Hydra - to mind-control them as they do us.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_PherocyteMastery=While it is antithetical to our interests that the aliens can so easily seize control of any human mind, it is very much in our interests to be able control minds ourselves - whether Hydra or human. Replicating the alien pherocyte cells has, as expected, been highly challenging, due to the profound biological differences between us and them. In fact, it has proven impossible. Artificially replicating their effects, however, has not. The playing field has at last been levelled.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_AppeaseVictory=Appease the Invaders
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_AppeaseVictory=We identify an approach which may convince the aliens to show tolerance towards humanity.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_AppeaseVictory=Before we can reach a compromise with the aliens, we must reach compromise amongst humanity. Agreeing on how to achieve this has been a far uglier business than anticipated, because the outcome we ultimately desire will require measures that take us beyond our moral comfort zone. Nevertheless, the path is decided. If we are to convince the invaders to negotiate, we can no longer wring our hands.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_CooperateVictory=A Cooperative Resolution
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_CooperateVictory=We seek a means of drawing the invaders to the negotiating table, in the hope of a peaceful tomorrow for all.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_CooperateVictory=We can no longer have our cake and eat it: that much is clear. We cannot be an organization that offers surrender with one hand, but slaughter with the other. Peace is the only realistic long-term outcome for humanity, and on that enough of us are now agreed. We will demand that those amongst us who hold more extreme views either compromise or leave. Once we are of one mind, no matter what it might cost us, we can enact our great plan: to prove decisively to the aliens that Earth is not theirs for the taking, but neither is it their enemy.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_DestroyVictory=Purify the Earth
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_DestroyVictory=We reach agreement on how best to drive the aliens away for good
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_DestroyVictory=We've been fighting back for some time now, doing all we can to protect the human race from an invasion that shows no signs of slowing down. But playing defense indefinitely is not a long-term solution, especially when other factions on Earth want to throw in the towel. It's time to play offense, before it's too late - and at last we've worked out exactly how we're going to do that.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_EscapeVictory=Leave the Cradle
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_EscapeVictory=We resolve to leave our solar system - and the sacrifices this will entail. 
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_EscapeVictory=Now that we have definitive proof that interstellar travel is not a pipedream, the question became not whether it was possible, but whether or not the time is right to pursue it ourselves. We are, after all, in the midst of an apparently hostile invasion. But, having weighed all the arguments, we have reasoned that this is but an irrelevance in the grand scheme of things. Any romantic attachments to humanity's ancient birthplace must now be shed, for we truly belong amongst the stars.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_ExploitVictory=Means to an End
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_ExploitVictory=We determine how to most effectively avail ourselves of the endless possibilities offered by the alien visitation. 
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_ExploitVictory=Where others see threat, we see only opportunity. There is no doubt that these aliens have access to resources and technologies we can only dream of  - so our foremost goal must be the acquisition of such wonders for ourselves. Achieving this is far from simple, but after extensive strategizing, a path is clear - though it is necessarily a somewhat indirect one. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_ResistVictory=Defend the Earth
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_ResistVictory=We compile everything we know about the aliens to date and create a road map towards our victory and very survival.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_ResistVictory=Since its inception, the ultimate intention of our movement has been something of an open question. Yes, we exist to keep Earth safe from the Hydra - but is that enough? After a great deal of soul-searching, debate and meticulous projections into how future extraterrestrial incursions might play out (and the dark paths our species might walk in consequence), we have found fresh purpose. Our plan is not only to put an end to this invasion, but also to remove humanity from the alien sphere of influence entirely.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_SubmitVictory=Path to Paradise
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_SubmitVictory=We seek the truth of truths for our movement: how to achieve true greatness while in the service of the aliens.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_SubmitVictory=Having attained a state of fragile safety, more and more of us now trust that the emissaries need not be feared. Yet this would be an unsatisfactory status quo. After much charged discussion amongst the faithful, we have achieved consensus; one which incorporates the views of both those who wish to serve the Hydra without question and those who see them as but a stepping stone for all humanity.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_CoexistencePact=Coexistence Pact
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_CoexistencePact=We establish exactly what will be required if we are to successfully meet the alien's shocking demands.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_CoexistencePact=Though some amongst us refuse, even now, to see it, our only hope of maintaining human society as we know it is to accede to the invaders' demands. This entails the Hydra effectively transforming Earth into a battle station - a bitter pill to swallow, to be sure, but less so than our total destruction. Those of us who accept that there is no alternative have agreed on a course of action - both for what, exactly, the so-called Sentinel project will require, and for the swift removal of any... obstacles that might stand in its way.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_APermanentPeace=A Permanent Peace
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_APermanentPeace=We seek to convince the aliens that a peaceable solution is the only possible solution.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_APermanentPeace=Any realistic chance of talking the Hydra down - i.e. ending this war through neither violence nor subjugation -  required breakthroughs on multiple fronts. The first was designing a weapon that could frighten even them. On this we have succeeded - at least in theory. The second was convincing our only still-wary captive to convince his kin that their current path leads only to mutually-assured destruction. Our intentions remain peaceable, but in order to achieve that, we have had to comport ourselves with a certain aggression. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_KilltheHive=Kill the Hive
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_KilltheHive=We devise a pherocyte-based bioweapon capable of ending the Hydra threat - permanently.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_KilltheHive=With the invaders' weakness now exposed, we have a theoretical means of annihilating them - but we cannot very well individually dispense our lethal cure to an unknown and perhaps effectively infinite number of Hydra in their distant lair. Thus, the second stage of this project has been focused not on the bioweapon itself, but on the delivery mechanism - one that can affect a maximum number of targets with a minimum of effort. This too has required a biological, rather than merely physical, solution - and, once again, has involved discovering a way to turn the aliens' most potent weapon against them. We already had our assassin's bullet, but now we have the rifle from which to fire it. We can begin.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheGreatJourney=The Great Journey Ahead
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheGreatJourney=We finalize plans for Project Bifrost - our means of leaving this solar system behind.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheGreatJourney=Despite our many technological advances, settling a new branch of humanity in the orbit of a distant star has required a profound step-change in our approach to spacecraft design. The speed and size of our first interstellar colony ship have been mere parts of the equation, rather than the end-goal in themselves. Because we cannot say exactly what awaits us in Chara, we have had to devise a vessel that can sustain human life in relative comfort for a generation, at least.<br/><br/> Some might say that the accomplishment of this is nothing short of a miracle - but it is nothing of the sort. It is, simply, the consequence of unbridled human ingenuity and resolve.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_EnslavetheMasters=Enslave the Masters
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_EnslavetheMasters=We establish how to turn the tables on our would-be oppressors, and thus become the dominant force in both our solar system and theirs.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_EnslavetheMasters=Following careful strategizing and wargaming every potential eventuality, it would seem that our plan to subjugate the Hydra requires a three-pronged assault, of sorts. First, we required a means of producing synthetic pherocytes at scale. Secondly, we needed a hand-picked, carefully-vetted team whom we can depend upon to fearlessly voyage through the wormhole and face unimaginable dangers, with no certainty of return. Thirdly, we had to make difficult decisions about the fate of the other major human factions - who should join us, who should be placated, and who must, for the greater good, be destroyed outright.<br/><br/>The first two of these have been successfully achieved; the third must now be enacted in tandem with our final assault against the Hydra.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheFinalAssault=The Final Assault
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheFinalAssault=We finalize our plans to engage the Hydra main force in an effort to secure our stellar border once and for all.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheFinalAssault=A consensus has been reached: Despite the dangers, the only certain method of ending the aliens' attempts at invasion is to collapse the wormhole, and with it their access to our solar system. This will require a joint operation of unprecedented scale. We have formed a strike team that will serve as the tip of the spear. To say that unknowns remain would perhaps be the greatest understatement in history - but all human civilization depends upon our success. We are focused. We are confident. We are ready.
 
TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheOneTruePath=The One True Path
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheOneTruePath=To prevent our total subjugation and strive toward a harmonious future, we seek to achieve a degree of compromise with the Hydra.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheOneTruePath=Though we perhaps cannot hope to ever be the Emissaries' equals, humanity deserves to be more to them than chattel. If granted greater freedoms, we could better aid them in their cause, and achieve greatness together. In order to convince them of this, we have used our ever-growing understanding of their language and culture to request an opportunity to prove our unfailing loyalty, once and for all. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_AlienFlora=Alien Flora
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_AlienFlora=Our biologists study the nonsapient life forms that were collected from several sites.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_AlienFlora=There was a finite amount to be gleaned from our study of the vegetative lifeform we have dubbed 'xenoflora', but not a lack of trying. The issue is that we have thus far been unable to fully crack its genetic make-up, for elements thereof are so, for lack of a better word, alien as to be thoroughly inscrutable to us at the present time. Neither have we been able to divine any clues as to its origin, other than to say it is most certainly not of this Earth. While we have previously observed some correlation between xenoflora growth and alien crash sites, causation now seems highly probable.<br/><br/>Even its behavior supports this conclusion - it spreads faster than any terrestrial flora or even fungus, and with eerie, almost machine-like regularity. To suggest that the xenoflora has been in some way genetically altered - or even wholly designed - would not be an unreasonable hypothesis. If left unchecked, it could very likely colonize a region in record time, preventing the growth of all other flora. To what end we do not yet know. It would therefore be prudent to find a way to limit the organism's spread, whether through military or biological means. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirComputers=Alien Computers
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirComputers=We attempt to decipher the purpose and operation of the machines seemingly used to control the alien spacecraft.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirComputers=To even identify the larger machines recovered from the alien ship has tested our finest scientific minds to the limit - they are so very far apart from our essential concept of a computing device. But though we are now confident that they are indeed computers of a sort, understanding their exact purpose and function is another matter entirely. Their interface is designed neither for human hands nor voices, while even their visual feedback is bewilderingly sparse. Our best hypothesis is that an array of unusual, spongy pads found within the most intact of these machines suggests some other form of sensory I/O - perhaps olfactory operation? Given human limitations on the deciphering and emanation of smell, this is not something that we can easily replicate, though we may be able to create synthetic alternatives in time.<br/><br/>The actual processing elements of the computer have been somewhat easier to categorize. As far as we can tell, they employ a highly advanced form of the quantum computing and photonics we ourselves have recently researched, which likely enables them to monitor, navigate and communicate across this solar system with an effectiveness we can as yet only dream of. 

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirRobotics=Alien Robotics
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirRobotics=We study the array of on-board machines used to maintain the alien craft and its living occupants.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirRobotics=Having gained limited comprehension of the visitors' computers, we have since been able to discern the function, if not yet the operation, of their robotics. These have proven significantly more straightforward to understand than were the computers. Their purpose is relatively familiar: maintenance and construction.<br/><br/>The former, as best we can tell, entails ensuring their ships keep flying efficiently, can repair damage without necessitating that their crew endanger themselves, and can automatically adapt to different atmospheric and gravitational conditions.<br/><br/>The latter appears to be for the small-scale creation of weapons, ammunition, armor and fuel, to spare the craft and its occupants from the regular need to resupply back at wherever they originate from. In this vein, we have also identified what we believe to be culinary robotics and medical machines - in other words, the craft can provide everything the aliens need to stay alive for potentially indefinite periods. As with the computers, these robotics bear signs of some manner of touch-free interface - our theory remains that aliens can somehow operate them via smell or pheromone alone.

TIProjectTemplate.displayName.Project_TheirWarships=Alien Warships
TIProjectTemplate.summary.Project_TheirWarships=We work toward an understanding of the alien fleet and its capabilities.
TIProjectTemplate.description.Project_TheirWarships=Perhaps the most oddly resassuring aspect of our earliest sightings of the alien craft traversing our Solar System is that they operated by the same fundamental scientific principles that we had believed governed the universe. Their materials and propulsion technologies were of course well beyond our capabilities, but we could at least see that these interplanetary warships were governed by Newton and Einstein and the rest, same as we are.<br/><br/>Now that we've had an up close look at one of their ships, though, we see we have much to learn. Their drives rely on a type of fusion using a hybrid of plasma containment techniques. Their radiators and heat sinks are amazingly efficient in their management of waste heat.<br/><br/>In time, our people may be able to reverse-engineer some aspects of their technology for our own uses, and derive ways to improve our combat capabilities against alien craft.
